P. Brownell,2024,social science,English,"Trauma Theory and Abuse, Neglect and Violence Across the Life Course","A literature review of recent prevalence and prospective studies on interpersonal violence (IPV) identifies a link among child abuse, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse that had not emerged from life-stage-specific studies on abuse, neglect, and violence against older persons. In line with a developmental understanding of IPV from a life course perspective, early life trauma is emerging as an explanatory theory of IPV across the life course. This paradigm shift in the field of elder abuse challenges more traditional explanations of IPV in old age, such as ageism, but opens up new opportunities for interventions leading to prevention and treatment of abuse, neglect, and violence against older adults. Prevalence studies that include older subjects and questions about violence experienced as children and younger adults consistently identify child abuse as a risk factor for IPV experienced in old age. Similarly, prospective studies on IPV that follow subjects from childhood to old age identify lifetime patterns of abuse. Qualitative studies of IPV in old age that include retrospective data suggest a link as well. IPV perpetrated against children and adults of all ages by persons in positions of trust can lead to trauma that has adverse lifelong behavioral and relational implications. This provides a link between trauma theory and violence against older people. Until recently, abuse, neglect, and violence were conceptualized differently based on the life stage of the victim. While historically the definitions for partner and non-partner violence diverged based on the life stage of victims, more recently this has begun to converge. Understanding violence from a life course and trauma-informed perspective better identifies risk factors and interventions for IPV against older adults. Intersectionality of age and gender variables demonstrate differences and similarities among populations studied.","Trauma Theory and Abuse, Neglect and Violence Across the Life Course A literature review of recent prevalence and prospective studies on interpersonal violence (IPV) identifies a link among child abuse, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse that had not emerged from life-stage-specific studies on abuse, neglect, and violence against older persons.

There are several barriers to self-reporting elder mistreatment, including fear of nursing home placement or losing autonomy or a caregiver. Existing strategies to identify elder mistreatment neglect to empower those who experience it with tools for self-reporting. In this project, we developed and evaluated the usability of VOICES, a self-administrated digital health tool that screens, educates, and motivates older adults to self-report elder mistreatment. Cross-sectional study with User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. Thirty eight community-dwelling and cognitively intact older adults aged 60 years and older, caregivers, clinicians, and social workers. A tablet-based self-administrated digital health tool that screens, educates, and motivates older adults to self-report elder mistreatment. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained from: (1) focus groups participants including: feedback from open-ended discussion, demographics, and a post-session survey; (2) usability evaluation including: demographics, usability measures, comfortability with technology, emotional state, and open-ended feedback. Focus group participants (n = 24) generally favored using a tablet-based tool to screen for elder mistreatment and expressed comfort answering questions on elder mistreatment using tablets. Usability evaluation participants (n = 14) overall scored VOICES a mean System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 86.6 (median = 88.8), higher than the benchmark SUS score of 68, indicating excellent ease of use. In addition, 93% stated that they would recommend the VOICES tool to others and 100% indicated understanding of VOICES' information and content. Our findings show that older adults are capable, willing, and comfortable with using the innovative and self-administrated digital tool for elder mistreatment screening. Our future plan is to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the use of VOICES in identifying suspicion of mistreatment.","Development and usability evaluation of VOICES: A digital health tool to identify elder mistreatment A major barrier for society in overcoming elder mistreatment is an inability to accurately identify victims.

It is thought that abuse in institutions is just as prevalent. Few systematic evidence of the scale of the problem exists in elder care facilities. The aim of this review is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the problem in institutional settings and to provide estimates of the prevalence of elder abuse in the past 12 months. Fourteen academic databases and other online platforms were systematically searched for studies on elder abuse. Additionally, 26 experts in the field were consulted to identify further studies. All studies were screened for inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted, and meta-analysis was conducted. Self-reported data from older residents and staff were considered separately. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria from an initial of 55 studies identified for review. Overall abuse estimates, based on staff reports, suggest that 64.2% of staff admitted to elder abuse in the past year. There were insufficient studies to calculate an overall prevalence estimate based on self-reported data from older residents. Prevalence estimates for abuse subtypes reported by older residents were highest for psychological abuse (33.4%), followed by physical (14.1%), financial (13.8%), neglect (11.6%), and sexual abuse (1.9%). The prevalence of elder abuse in institutions is high. Global action to improve surveillance and monitoring of institutional elder abuse is vital to inform policy action to prevent elder abuse.","The prevalence of elder abuse in institutional settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis A recent study has shown that close to one in six older adults have experienced elder abuse in a community setting in the past year.

The Opening the Door (OTD) training was developed in a multidisciplinary setting and designed in collaboration with APS workers to enhance their engagement skills in potential EA cases and thus maximize the possibility of disclosure. Rooted in a relational approach and utilizing adult learning theory, it is divided into three main topics: Preparing for Engagement, Engagement Practice, and Processing Engagement. The eight-hour training was piloted with three groups of urban APS caseworkers with a wide range of work experience. Pre- and post-tests and case reflections indicate a positive impact on caseworkers' sense of self-efficacy, while focus groups indicate the necessity for ongoing provision of trainings and development of additional supports for APS caseworkers.

M. Neuberg; V. Pudmej Ešegović; M. Križaj; T. Cikač; T. Meštrović,2022,medical,English,Abuse and neglect of older people in health facilities from the perspective of nursing professionals: A cross-sectional study from Croatia,"Abuse and neglect of older people represent a salient public health issue that remains understudied in the current literature. However, most studies have focused on estimating the prevalence of mistreatment of older people, while litter priority has been put on healthcare professionals and their role in addressing this problem. The aim of this paper was to determine nurses' perceptions of neglect and abuse of older persons within health facilities in Croatia. A cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling approach was conducted on 632 nursing professionals between 26 March and 26 April 2020. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. A questionnaire from Drennan et al. (NCPOP, University College Dublin, Dublin, 2012), previously adapted by Neuberg et al. (Arch Ind Hyg Toxicol, 68, 2017, 190), was used as a survey instrument. Descriptive and inferential statistics has been used, as well as multivariable methods (reliability analysis). Significance was set at p < .05 (two-tailed). Abuse/neglect of older people was observed by 13.8% to 57.4% of nursing professionals, depending on the incident type. The most prevalent incidents observed were ignoring the call of an older person (57.4%), shouting at an older person in anger (41.1%) and force-feeding an older person (34.5%), while the least prevalent incidents observed were denial of food or some privileges as a form of punishment (13.8%). Male nursing professionals reported observing various forms of abuse significantly more often than their female counterparts (p = .038), without statistically significant age-related differences. Furthermore, mistreatment of older people was much more frequently observed in nursing homes (p = .013), with suboptimal the ratio of caregivers and care recipients, as well as by nursing professionals who work in shifts (p = .012). Reliability analysis demonstrated a satisfactory level of internal consistency for the used questionnaire. This study reinforces neglect and abuse of older people as a growing public health problem and puts the emphasis on its perception; hence, there is a need for systematic and continuous training of nursing professionals on preventing, identifying and responding to such mistreatment, with the aim of enhancing the quality of life in this vulnerable group. This study contributes to the growing body of research on the quality of evidence-based nursing care of older people, most notably from providers' perspective - with direct implications for policy, practice, research and training.","Abuse and neglect of older people in health facilities from the perspective of nursing professionals: A cross-sectional study from Croatia Abuse and neglect of older people represent a salient public health issue that remains understudied in the current literature.

"Wamara, Charles Kiiza;Bennich, Maria;Strandberg, Thomas",2021,social science,English,Missing voices: Older people’s perspectives on being abused in Uganda,"Abuse of older people is a major challenge for people who are aging. Studies into older people’s perspectives on abuse focus mainly on developed countries, while the views of those in sub-Saharan Africa remain largely unheard in social research. To address this imbalance, we report a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to examine older people’s perceptions of abuse in Uganda. Thirty-three participants were selected from four districts of Uganda to reflect different locations, levels of development, cultures, and contexts. Behaviors considered abusive were categorized into five themes: economic abuse, harassment and violence, disrespect, neglect and abandonment, and discrimination. Results showed that participants largely viewed their abuse from a cultural perspective, contrary to the West’s perception based on a discourse of human rights. The findings show the need for a broader definition that includes the cultural dimensions of the abuse of older people in developing societies.","Missing voices: Older people’s perspectives on being abused in Uganda Abuse of older people is a major challenge for people who are aging.

Yet, their effectiveness in reducing different types of mistreatment in relation to services is unknown. This study aimed to address the knowledge gap by identifying services provided by mistreatment type, and examining the associations of services with mistreatment reduction. A pretest–post-test design was implemented using the Identification, Services, and Outcomes (ISO) Matrix to assess mistreatment levels during case investigation and at case closure after services were provided. San Francisco and Napa APS participated in a 6-month data collection. The 4 most prevalent types of mistreatment were examined: emotional, physical, financial abuse, and neglect by others. On average, level of mistreatment decreased across mistreatment types after APS intervention. Care/case management, mental health, and other services were most common, while specific services differed depending on type of mistreatment. Care/case management services were associated with physical and emotional abuse reduction, legal services further correlated with emotional abuse reduction; financial planning services were associated with financial abuse reduction; care/case management and other services were associated with neglect reduction. This is the first study to address APS services by mistreatment type and the outcomes of services. Adoption of the ISO Matrix by APS programs opens the possibility of research and practice collaboration in APS outcomes research using a standardized approach.","Examining Adult Protective Services Outcomes: Services Associated With the Decrease of Mistreatment Differed by Elder Mistreatment Type Adult Protective Services (APS) are the frontline agencies investigating elder mistreatment and providing/coordinating postinvestigation services.

"Steinman, Kenneth J.;Anetzberger, Georgia J.",2022,social science,English,Measuring the diverse characteristics of county adult protective services programs,"Adult protective services (APS) programs vary markedly, yet few studies have quantified this diversity. In 2020, a survey of Ohio’s 85 county-administered APS programs incorporated subsequent feedback from staff and described the programs in a systematic manner. This process resulted in a 100% response rate and illustrated an efficient approach to measuring organizational characteristics (e.g., whether any staff are mostly dedicated to APS), resources (e.g., access to multidisciplinary teams), and practices (e.g., how often staff create a plan to meet client goals). The prevalence of many factors differed by the number of older adults the program served. For instance, 75% of programs in large counties had regular opportunities to share complex cases with a multidisciplinary team, compared to 28% of programs in small counties. Understanding the diverse characteristics of APS programs – and how to measure them – can help agencies guide quality improvement efforts and the dissemination of innovations.","Measuring the diverse characteristics of county adult protective services programs Adult protective services (APS) programs vary markedly, yet few studies have quantified this diversity.

Therefore, we sought to describe APS workers’ work environments and responses to occupational hazards and stressors, including compassion fatigue, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. Survey data were gathered with closed-ended questionnaires administered to APS workers in an urban setting. Virtually all workers (97%) reported exposure to one or more environmental hazards in their work, and 80% reported hazard exposure in the past month. Workers also reported mixed responses to their work environment and to experiences with supervision. A sizable minority (22.7%) was at high risk for burnout, 24.6% were at risk for secondary traumatic stress, and 19.9% reported low compassion satisfaction. The results document multiple stressors in APS work. The APS partner is committed to ongoing efforts to better support its staff, and these findings can inform future efforts to enhance supervisor support and worker self-care, to minimize burnout and secondary traumatic stress.","Professional quality of life of adult protective service workers Adult Protective Services (APS) workers are exposed to substantial occupational hazards and job stress, but these stressors are underdocumented.

"Manthorpe, Jill;Martineau, Stephen",2017,social science,English,Engaging with the new system of safeguarding adults reviews concerning care homes for older people,"Adult Serious Case Reviews (SCRs) investigate situations in which harm to or death of a vulnerable adult has occurred, or where abuse or neglect was suspected and local agencies’ responses were deemed in need of scrutiny. Under the 2014 Care Act, in England, SCRs have moved to a statutory footing, being renamed Safeguarding Adults Reviews (SARs). This paper reports an analysis of SCRs concerning older residents of care homes conducted in 2015. While there is a clear forensic methodology for investigating single cases that indicate multi-agency failings of safeguarding, ‘whole home’ or ‘collective abuse’ investigations are difficult to undertake, requiring review of numerous records and consultations. Failure to recognise abuse may reflect professionals’ uncertainties about thresholds for action when encountering poor care quality or abuse and the exclusion of social workers from involvement with the care and support of care home residents. SCRs sometimes comment on sub-optimal support for care home residents from local social work practitioners or hint at missed opportunities. Reflections on what needs to change in local systems of care and support may include new scope for the development of gerontological social work practice.","Engaging with the new system of safeguarding adults reviews concerning care homes for older people Adult Serious Case Reviews (SCRs) investigate situations in which harm to or death of a vulnerable adult has occurred, or where abuse or neglect was suspected and local agencies’ responses were deemed in need of scrutiny.

Using a mixed-method approach in two exploratory cross-sectional studies (N = 512), we brought support for a proposed conceptual difference between ageism toward older adults and ageism toward older patients which may facilitate the identification of ageism in healthcare settings. We also investigated whether nurses’ moral sensitivity could buffer the negative effect of socio-cognitive factors on ageism against older patients. Our findings supported our assumption, suggesting that fostering nurses’ moral sensitivity could be a promising new avenue to prevent and combat ageism in nurses, together with comprehensive gerontological education meant to decrease stereotyping and help nurses fulfill their roles of moral advocates against older patient discrimination.","Ageism against older patients in nursing: Conceptual differentiations and the role of moral sensitivity Ageism in nursing is difficult to identify, prevent and combat.

"Gao, Xiang",2016,social science,English,Prevalence and risk factors of elder maltreatment among Chinese Americans,"All ethnic groups in the U.S. have suffered from elder maltreatment (EM), but literature on this topic among Chinese Americans is sparse. Only one group of researchers has exclusively focused on the EM experiences of Chinese Americans in the U.S. A recent study indicated the prevalence rate of EM was 24% among residential-dwelling Chinese American elders and the most prevalent forms of EM are psychological maltreatment (10%) and financial maltreatment (10%). However, the effect of family relationship and cultural factors on EM have not yet been explored. The traditional Chinese culture emphasizing family cohesion and filial piety, along with the acculturation stress and language barriers may increase the risks of EM in this population. This exploratory research aimed to understand EM perpetrated by family members in residential settings among Chinese American elders and the risk factors of EM in this population, focusing on the Phoenix metropolitan area. Particularly, understanding EM through both a cultural lens and a legal lens shed light on the roles of socio-cultural variables (family support and cultural variables) associated with EM among Chinese American elders, one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the U.S. To achieve these research aims, a larger quantitative component building on a small qualitative component was utilized. In Phase I, focus groups were conducted to ensure subsequent survey questions were culturally and linguistically appropriate. Feedback from the focus groups was used to refine the questionnaire designed for this study. In Phase II, revised questionnaires were distributed to 266 Chinese American older adults to detect EM prevalence and to identify the factors associated with victimization. The ecological theory provides guidance for the study. In the end, one of ten Chinese American elders experienced general EM perpetrated by family members. The dominant forms of EM, elder neglect and emotional maltreatment, may have serious emotional outcomes and threaten the well-being of Chinese elders. To prevent the occurrence and recurrence of EM, service professionals and gatekeepers in the community need to work with Chinese American families to reduce elders’ depression levels, promote family cohesion and eliminate the intergenerational culture/acculturation differences.","Prevalence and risk factors of elder maltreatment among Chinese Americans All ethnic groups in the U.S. have suffered from elder maltreatment (EM), but literature on this topic among Chinese Americans is sparse.

"Kpessa-Whyte, Michael",2018,social science,English,Aging and demographic transition in Ghana: State of the elderly and emerging issues,"Although the population of Ghana is young and generally youthful, there is evidence of rapid increases in the size of the elderly cohort. Although demographic projections estimate that the proportion of the population younger than 15 years will experience continuous decline overtime due in part to decline in fertility, the rise in the elderly population is expected to also continue due to declining mortality rates resulting in longevity. Unfortunately, the growth in the elderly proportion of the population is occurring at the same time traditional systems of protection and care for the aged are breaking down on account of urbanization, socioeconomic development, and globalization. This has implications for public policy and the overall wellbeing of the elderly.

"Crowder, Jolie;Burnett, Camille;Laughon, Kathryn;Dreisbach, Caitlin",2019,health/care,English,Elder abuse in American Indian communities: An integrative review,"American Indian elders have one of the lowest life expectancies in the United States. Disproportionate disease burden, socioeconomic disparities, and higher rates of violence across the lifespan are thought to contribute to higher rates of elder abuse. Elder abuse and higher rates of trauma exposure are linked with adverse outcomes. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines informed the methodology and assessment of the literature on elder abuse among American Indians. Of the nine studies published in the last 30 years, rates of elder abuse varied by study, location, and tribal affiliation from 4.3% to 45.9%. Large studies with comparison populations found higher rates for American Indians. There was a consensus for three risk factors: substance abuse, mental health problems, and caregiving issues. Importance of tribal norms, the notion of respect conferred to elders, and the concept of acculturation were major culturally relevant themes. Perceived tribal norms and strengths, for example, respect for elders, were at odds with abuse experiences, particularly financial exploitation and neglect. Historical trauma, shame, and fear impacted reporting. There was little consistency in study designs, most were qualitative or mixed methods, samples were small, there was no common measurement tool or time frame for abuse, and there was only one intervention study. High rates of abuse suggest healthcare providers should be encouraged to screen and intervene despite the lack of empirical evidence. Providers should not assume that traditional culturally ascribed strengths, such as honor and respect for elders, provide any degree of protection against elder abuse.","Elder abuse in American Indian communities: An integrative review American Indian elders have one of the lowest life expectancies in the United States.

Choo,2021,medical,English,Malay version of the modified Conflict Tactics Scale of elder abuse and neglect (MMCTS-EAN): Validation and methodological challenges,"Among the challenges in systematic inquiry into elder abuse and neglect (EAN) is the lack of standardized tool of measurement. Existing literature demonstrates diverse tools being used, with the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) and its versions being the most common. The Malaysian Elder Mistreatment Project (MAESTRO) utilized the Modified CTS developed and used by the National Study of Elder Abuse and Neglect in Ireland (NSEA-I). This article aimed to validate this Malay version of the modified CTS for use in the Malaysian context and by Malay-speaking populations across Southeast Asia while highlighting the various practical and methodological challenges encountered along the process. Data were collected from 1927 older respondents who lived in Kuala Pilah district. Preliminary data screening led to the dropping of 10 items due to 0 variance. Further four items were deleted during CFA due to low loading. The indicators of neglect factor were made into a composite factor due to high collinearity. The final scale had acceptable reliability and validity. This tool is likely to assist in assessing and detecting EAN more quickly and conveniently. It will also assist future researches of EAN in taking into account the issues that arise in the measurement of EAN.","Malay version of the modified Conflict Tactics Scale of elder abuse and neglect (MMCTS-EAN): Validation and methodological challenges Among the challenges in systematic inquiry into elder abuse and neglect (EAN) is the lack of standardized tool of measurement.

The final scale had acceptable reliability and validity. This tool is likely to assist in assessing and detecting EAN more quickly and conveniently.

Although several instruments have been developed in China to measure elder abuse, they present several limitations. The instrument development involved three components: (1) generating questionnaire items; (2) questionnaire testing and data collection in older adults; and (3) psychometric evaluation of the Domestic Elder Abuse Scale (DEAS). We collected questionnaire responses from 3725 community-dwelling Chinese older adults. The 26-item DEAS showed good reliability and validity across five dimensions: physical abuse, psychological abuse, financial exploitation, neglect, and abandonment. These five factors accounted for 78.432 % of the total variance, and model fitting results were acceptable. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.975, and the test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.934 after 2 weeks. This study developed a five-dimension instrument to measure elder abuse, with good psychometric properties, which can play an essential role in community-based studies in China.","The domestic elder abuse in China: Scale development and psychometric properties An effective screening tool is essential to elder abuse research.

To address this, we developed the Vulnerable Elder Protection Team (VEPT), an ED-based interdisciplinary consultation service. We describe our initial experience in the first two years after the program launch. We launched VEPT in a large, urban, academic ED/hospital. From 4/3/17 to 4/2/19, we tracked VEPT activations, including patient characteristics, assessment, and interventions. We compared VEPT activations to frequency of elder abuse identification in the ED before VEPT launch. We examined outcomes for patients evaluated by VEPT, including change in living situation at discharge. We assessed ED providers' experiences with VEPT via written surveys and focus groups. During the program's initial two years, VEPT was activated and provided consultation/care to 200 ED patients. Cases included physical abuse (59%), neglect (56%), financial exploitation (32%), verbal/emotional/psychological abuse (25%), and sexual abuse (2%). Sixty-two percent of patients assessed were determined by VEPT to have high or moderate suspicion for elder abuse. Seventy-five percent of these patients had a change in living/housing situation or were discharged with new or additional home services, with 14% discharged to an elder abuse shelter, 39% to a different living/housing situation, and 22% with new or additional home services. ED providers reported that VEPT made them more likely to consider/assess for elder abuse and recognized the value of the expertise and guidance VEPT provided. Ninety-four percent reported believing that there is merit in establishing a VEPT Program in other EDs. VEPT was frequently activated and many patients were discharged with changes in living situation and/or additional home services, which may improve safety.

Our objective was to determine the incidence and prevalence of caregiver abuse and neglect among U.S. adults with advanced MS. Through an anonymous telephone survey with the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS), we administered the validated Scale to Report Emotional Stress Signs – Multiple Sclerosis (STRESS-MS) and other study measures to 206 U.S. adults who had unpaid caregivers because of MS-related disability. 54.9% of respondents disclosed undergoing some form of mistreatment since first requiring caregiving by a family member or friend, including psychological abuse (44.2%), financial abuse (25.2%), neglect (16.5%), physical abuse (11.2%) or sexual abuse (8.3%). Many had experienced multiple forms of mistreatment. Mistreated respondents reported less social support, more alcohol use, and higher levels of fatigue and cognitive impairment. Daily caregiving increased mistreatment risk. Caregivers with mental illness were 13 times more likely to be abusive or neglectful. Poor premorbid relationships with caregivers nearly tripled mistreatment risk, while any significant alcohol use history by people with MS or caregivers doubled risk. In a nationwide survey, over 50% of American adults with advanced MS reported mistreatment by caregivers.","Abuse and neglect of people with multiple sclerosis: A survey with the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) An estimated 100,000 Americans with advanced multiple sclerosis (MS) are at risk of mistreatment, yet we lack national prevalence data on abuse and neglect.

S. Chane; M. E. Adamek,2015,social science,English,“Death Is Better Than Misery”: Elders' Accounts of Abuse and Neglect in Ethiopia,"As the proportion of elders in developing nations increases and the ability of families to meet their needs is stretched thin, the risk of elder abuse will grow. This study examined the types and nature of abuse and neglect from the perspective of elders in Ethiopia who experienced abuse in noninstitutional settings. A qualitative design guided by hermeneutic phenomenology was used to explore the lived experiences of abuse and neglect of 15 Ethiopian elders.

Treating perceptions of elderly care receiver’s under-accommodative behaviors (i.e., communication problems, painful self-disclosure, and patronizing talk) as moderators, relationships between family caregiver’s characteristics and forms of elder abuse/neglect were examined. Adult family caregivers (N = 220) were surveyed. The results suggested partial support of the proposed model. Caregivers’ perceptions of their elderly care receivers’ under-accommodation significantly moderated the relationships between different caregiver characteristics and all three forms of abuse. Discussion focused on the theoretical contribution of the findings, and the potential influence of the three under-accommodative behaviors in the family caregiving context.","Elder abuse and neglect: Examining caregiver characteristics and perceptions of their elderly care receiver’s under-accommodative behavior Based on the literature on family violence, intergenerational communication, and elder abuse, and the communication accommodation theory, this study tested a revised model of communication-based model of elder abuse and neglect.

The Disorganized Response Scale (DRS) was created and administered to 640 university students, and its associations with variables known to covary with DA, such as childhood maltreatment, insecure attachment, and psychological symptoms, were examined. Factor analysis of DRS items revealed a single 15-item dimension that reflected participants’ self-reported disorganized responses when discussing their childhoods. Structural equation modeling indicated a good fit to a model in which fearful caretaking and childhood abuse and neglect were associated with the DRS. In turn, the DRS, along with anxious and avoidant attachment, was independently related to symptoms and partially mediated the relationship between child maltreatment and symptomatology. Hierarchical multiple regression indicated that the DRS accounted for significant additional variance in posttraumatic stress, externalization, somatization, and, especially, dissociation, even after demographics and both anxious and avoidant attachment were taken into account. Analyses support the construct validity of the DRS as a measure of disorganized attachment-related responses in adults. Further research is indicated to replicate these findings and to evaluate their convergence with interview measures of DA.","The Disorganized Response Scale: Construct validity of a potential self-report measure of disorganized attachment Based on the paucity of self-report measures of disorganized attachment (DA), we developed and tested a scale examining adults’ self-reported disorganized verbalizations, cognitions, and behaviors when discussing their childhoods.

Keygnaert,2022,health/care,English,Challenges in Conducting Sexual Health and Violence Research in Older Adults Beyond the General Data Protection Regulation: A Belgian Case Study,"Because of a growing older population, the sexual health (SH) of older adults, including sexual violence (SV), is becoming an increasingly important public health concern. Yet, reliable SV prevalence rates and risk factors are lacking, due to methodological shortcomings in current studies. SV research involves challenges regarding safety and disclosure, especially in older adults. In this paper, we reflect on the methods used in a sexual health and violence (SH&V) study in older adults balancing between privacy rules imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ethical and safety guidelines. To ensure the acceptability of the questionnaire, it was tested in a two-phase pilot study. To maximize SV disclosure, the questionnaire built up gradually towards the more sensitive SV modules. Interviewers were trained to approach participants in a non-judgmental manner. Due to GDPR, our data collection method was changed from a random sampling via the National Register to a cluster random probability sampling with a random walk finding approach. Older adults were willing to discuss SH&V during a structured face-to-face interview with trained interviewers. Following strict safety guidelines, no major incidents were reported. The cluster random probability sampling with random walk finding approach provided an adequate sampling frame, but was inefficient and time-consuming. Doing research on SH&V in older adults is feasible but requires a substantial investment of time and the challenges involved may incur greater costs. In order to guarantee further research on sensitive topics in older adults, we recommend that an interdisciplinary expert group consisting of researchers, donors, and policymakers investigates how GDPR and public health research in hard-to-reach populations can be better matched.","Challenges in Conducting Sexual Health and Violence Research in Older Adults Beyond the General Data Protection Regulation: A Belgian Case Study Because of a growing older population, the sexual health (SH) of older adults, including sexual violence (SV), is becoming an increasingly important public health concern.

N. Rathnayake; S. De Silva Weliange; G. N. D. Guruge,2021,social science,English,Effectiveness of a health promotion intervention to address determinants of child neglect in a disadvantaged community in Sri Lanka,"Child neglect is a form of child maltreatment and it is a neglected area of research. As similar to other forms of maltreatment, neglect also results in negative health outcomes for children. Child neglect is concentrated in disadvantaged communities. The community-centered health promotion approach empowers communities to identify and address determinants of perceived health issues. This study aimed to implement a health promotion intervention to enable a disadvantaged community to address determinants of child neglect and evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. A quasi-experimental study design was used. Two disadvantaged communities in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka with similar socio-demographic characteristics were purposively selected as the experimental and control study settings. The mothers who have at least one child in the age range 5–18 years were included in the sample. The sample included 42 mothers from the experimental group and 44 mothers from the control group. The elder children of mothers in the experimental group were selected to be the agents of change. A health promotion intervention was implemented only with the experimental setting. The steps of the intervention included; (1) identifying prevention of child neglect as a goal, (2) understanding the determinants, (3) analyzing determinants and identifying actions and (4) implementing and modifying the actions. The total study duration was 1 year, with the intervention taking an average of 6 months. Data were collected at both pre and post-intervention phases from mothers and children through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Mothers of the experimental group improved their knowledge on child neglect significantly in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05). In the post-intervention phase, there were significant differences in attitudes related to child neglect between experimental and control groups (p < 0.05). Following the health promotion intervention, mothers of the experimental group had significantly improved their practices related to the safety, education, nutrition of children, relationships with the child and social support for child caring (p < 0.05) when compared with the control group. The health promotion intervention was effective in addressing the selected determinants of child neglect in a disadvantaged community. Children could act as active agents of change to deliver the interventions to their mothers (perpetrators).","Effectiveness of a health promotion intervention to address determinants of child neglect in a disadvantaged community in Sri Lanka Child neglect is a form of child maltreatment and it is a neglected area of research.

To explore a possible relationship between childhood maltreatment and ultra-high risk of psychosis in a non-help-seeking population in a low- and middle-income country. A household survey was conducted in Sao Paulo, Brazil, involving over 2,500 individuals aged 18–30 years who were randomly selected from the general population. The participants underwent screening with the Prodromal Questionnaire. Ultra-high risk status was assessed using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes, and childhood maltreatment was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. The final sample comprised 87 ultra-high risk individuals and 115 controls. Childhood maltreatment was significantly more present among ultra-high risk individuals. In ultra-high risk individuals, physical and emotional neglect were inversely related to grandiosity symptoms, physical abuse was related to perceptual abnormalities and physical neglect was related to disorganized speech and thought. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and ultra-high risk status and psychopathological features in a large Latin American sample.

"Burnes, David",2017,social science,English,Community elder mistreatment intervention with capable older adults: Toward a conceptual practice model,"Community-based elder mistreatment response programs (EMRP), such as adult protective services, that are responsible for directly addressing elder abuse and neglect are under increasing pressure with greater reporting/referrals nationwide. Our knowledge and understanding of effective response interventions represents a major gap in the EM literature. At the center of this gap is a lack of theory or conceptual models to help guide EMRP research and practice. This article develops a conceptual practice model for community-based EMRPs that work directly with cognitively intact EM victims. Anchored by core EMRP values of voluntariness, self-determination, and least restrictive path, the practice model is guided by an overarching postmodern, constructivist, eco-systemic practice paradigm that accepts multiple, individually constructed mistreatment realities and solutions. Harm-reduction, client-centered, and multidisciplinary practice models are described toward a common EMRP goal to reduce the risk of continued mistreatment. Finally, the model focuses on client–practitioner relationship-oriented practice skills such as engagement and therapeutic alliance to elicit individual mistreatment realities and client-centered solutions. The practice model helps fill a conceptual gap in the EM intervention literature and carries implications for EMRP training, research, and practice.","Community elder mistreatment intervention with capable older adults: Toward a conceptual practice model Community-based elder mistreatment response programs (EMRP), such as adult protective services, that are responsible for directly addressing elder abuse and neglect are under increasing pressure with greater reporting/referrals nationwide.

"Boddington, Paula;Featherstone, Katie",2018,health/care,English,The canary in the coal mine: Continence care for people with dementia in acute hospital wards as a crisis of dehumanization,"Continence is a key moment of care that can tell us about the wider care of people living with dementia within acute hospital wards. The spotlight is currently on the quality of hospital care of older people across the UK, yet concerns persist about their poor treatment, neglect, abuse, and discrimination within this setting. Thus, within hospitals, the care of people living with dementia is both a welfare issue and a human rights issue. The challenge of continence care for people living with dementia can be seen as the ‘canary in the coal mine’ for the unravelling of dignity within the acute setting. This paper draws on an ethnographic study within five hospitals in England and Wales, selected to represent a range of hospital types, geographies and socio-economic catchments. Observational fieldwork was carried out over 154 days in acute hospitals known to admit large numbers of people living with dementia. This paper starts to fill the gap between theory and data by providing an in-depth ethnographic analysis examining the ways in which treatment as a person is negotiated, achieved or threatened. We examine how the twin assaults on agency of a diagnosis of dementia and of incontinence threaten personhood. The acute threats to this patient group may then act to magnify perils to treatment as a person. Our findings suggest that personal dignity and the social construction of moral personhood are both threatened and maintained in such a setting. We show how empirical ethnographic data can lend weight to, and add detail to, theoretical accounts of moral personhood and dignity.","The canary in the coal mine: Continence care for people with dementia in acute hospital wards as a crisis of dehumanization Continence is a key moment of care that can tell us about the wider care of people living with dementia within acute hospital wards.

"Han, S. Duke;Mosqueda, Laura",2020,medical,English,Elder abuse in the COVID‐19 era,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is particularly deleterious to older adults, and there has been a massive increase in reports of elder abuse during the pandemic. Reports of elder abuse range from financial scams to incidents of family violence, with public warnings issued accordingly from the Federal Trade Commission and the American Bar Association. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines elder abuse as an intentional act or failure to act by a caregiver or another person in a relationship involving an expectation of trust that causes or creates a risk of harm to an older adult. Abuse of older adults can be physical, emotional, financial, neglect, or any combination of these. To better understand the complex dynamics that lead to elder abuse, our group developed a theoretical model called the Abuse Intervention/Prevention Model (AIM). This model focuses on three core and intersecting considerations: (1) the vulnerable older adult, (2) the trusted other, and (3) the context in which the abuse occurs. We consider each of these in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and end with suggested ways to mitigate the risks.","Elder abuse in the COVID‐19 era Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is particularly deleterious to older adults, and there has been a massive increase in reports of elder abuse during the pandemic.

S. A. Drake; A. Akande; P. A. Kelly; Y. Yang; D. A. Wolf,2021,health/care,English,Identifying gaps and improving investigation of fatal elder abuse and/or neglect,"Death investigator and autopsy reports for decedents 65 years and older within a major metropolitan area over a five-year period were assessed for the possibility of elder abuse and/or neglect. The study consisted of two stages. A simple two-question screening criteria was used to determine whether the decedent was (1) dependent on another for at least one activity of daily living and (2) had a presence of at least one indicator of abuse and/or neglect. Second, only cases with affirmative criteria responses were reviewed to identify inconsistent or deficient variables that precluded (or if present, allowed) determination of abuse and/or neglect. A multidisciplinary panel of local and national experts, including forensic pathologists, law enforcement, and geriatricians assessed these indicators as indicative of presence of abuse/neglect, and these indicators were subsequently developed as a supplemental data collection tool. Of a possible 2798 cases, 2324 (83%) were excluded using the screening criteria. This reduced the number of cases that warranted further investigation to 474 (17% of elderly deaths in this timeframe). All 474 decedents were dependent on another for at least one ADL and 322 (68%) had unexplained injuries. In 180 (38%) cases had recorded notation of a suspicion of abuse and/or neglect at the time of death. The results support the premise that a simple, two-criterion screening can effectively identify cases of potential abuse and/or neglect and, when followed by a supplemental data collection tool, cases can be efficiently evaluated.","Identifying gaps and improving investigation of fatal elder abuse and/or neglect Death investigator and autopsy reports for decedents 65 years and older within a major metropolitan area over a five-year period were assessed for the possibility of elder abuse and/or neglect.

In this study, we analyzed both informal caregiver’s perceptions of maltreatment and aspects of the caregiver and caregiving behavior that may be associated with maltreatment. We conducted five focus groups (FGs) in three Spanish cities: Segovia, Soria and León. The themes that were identified were related to two levels of maltreatment: (a) relational and (b) institutional. At the relational level, we observed the justification of maltreatment of Older Adults with Dementia (OAswD) by family caregivers during the occurrence of behavioral symptoms. At the institutional level, we noted that lack of support from the government was considered a type of maltreatment. These themes suggest that policy issues related to healthcare should be considered.","Family caregivers’ perceptions of maltreatment of older adults with dementia: Findings from the northwest of Spain Dementia is a neurocognitive disorder that implies a risk factor of maltreatment by family caregivers.

The purpose of this paper is to report on the design and methodology of a population-based cohort study on elder mistreatment among the older Malaysian population. The study aims at gathering data and evidence to estimate the prevalence and incidence of elder mistreatment, identify its individual, familial and social determinants, and quantify its health consequences. This is a community-based prospective cohort study using randomly selected households from the national census. A multistage sampling method was employed to obtain a total of 2496 older adults living in the rural Kuala Pilah district. The study is divided into two phases: cross-sectional study (baseline), and a longitudinal follow-up study at the third and fifth years. Elder mistreatment was measured using instrument derived from the previous literature and modified Conflict Tactic Scales. Outcomes of elder mistreatment include mortality, physical function, mental health, quality of life and health utilisation. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationship between risk factors and abuse estimates. Cox proportional hazard regression will be used to estimate risk of mortality associated with abuse. Associated annual rate of hospitalisation and health visit frequency, and reporting of abuse, will be estimated using Poisson regression. The study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University of Malaya Medical Center (MEC Ref 902.2) and the Malaysian National Medical Research Register (NMRR-12-1444-11726). Written consent was obtained from all respondents prior to baseline assessment and subsequent follow-up. Findings will be disseminated to local stakeholders via forums with community leaders, and health and social welfare departments, and published in appropriate scientific journals and presented at conferences.","Elder mistreatment in a community dwelling population: the Malaysian Elder Mistreatment Project (MAESTRO) cohort study protocol Despite being now recognised as a global health concern, there is still an inadequate amount of research into elder mistreatment, especially in low and middle-income regions.

J. López; G. Pérez-Rojo; C. Noriega; C. Velasco,2021,social science,English,Personal and Work-Related Factors Associated with Good Care for Institutionalized Older Adults,"Despite efforts to promote good care, many institutionalized older adults (IOA) experience elevated neglectful conditions and reduced person-centered care approaches. Based on the job demand–control model, this study aimed to analyze the relationship between nursing home professionals’ personal and organizational factors and good care provided to institutionalized older people. Data was collected through a self-administered survey completed by 208 nursing home staff members. Three dimensions of personal factors (i.e., personal accomplishment, depersonalization, and negative old age stereotypes) were significant predictors of good care. Depersonalization and negative old age stereotypes were negatively associated with IOA, and both good care and personal accomplishment were positively associated with good care in nursing homes. Only one work-related factor (i.e., management support) was positively associated with good care. Personal factors may play a significant role in good care. Management support offers a promising mechanism to promote good care among nursing home professionals. The findings support the need to change the focus on entirely completing care tasks to providing good care of residents in nursing homes that promotes management support, personal accomplishment, personalization and positive old age consideration, attitudes, and behaviors. Policies and interventions should be developed to address in a more humanized way.","Personal and Work-Related Factors Associated with Good Care for Institutionalized Older Adults Despite efforts to promote good care, many institutionalized older adults (IOA) experience elevated neglectful conditions and reduced person-centered care approaches.

A lack of practical training on EA/N has been identified as a barrier. This article describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of an innovative virtual-reality-based educational intervention intended to improve EA/N recognition and reporting among nurses and social workers providing in-home services. The educational intervention consisted of two parts, including an introductory course and advanced assessment training in virtual reality. The advanced assessment training was focused on learning to use the QualCare Scale, an instrument used to assess quality of family caregiving. Data was evaluated in terms of user satisfaction, changes in knowledge, and changes in practice. Results indicate that participants were satisfied with the content and format of the training program. Participants made gains in knowledge in identification and had 99% accuracy in their mandatory reporting decisions. Importantly, professionals reported making changes in their daily practice based on knowledge and skills learnt. Evaluation data indicate that this interdisciplinary training program was a satisfactory way to learn that produced changes in knowledge and impacted clinical practice. Few implementation barriers were encountered during this project suggesting it would be replicable.","EATI Island – A virtual-reality-based elder abuse and neglect educational intervention Despite high prevalence rates of elder abuse and neglect (EA/N), compliance with mandatory reporting remains low.

Pettit,2020,social science,English,Exploring an Emerging Measurement Issue in Older Adult Maltreatment: Exploitation of Older Adults’ Residences,"Despite nationwide housing challenges that might lead to the exploitation of older adults’ housing resources, exploitation of older adults’ residences has not been a focus of measurement in the rapidly developing field of elder abuse and neglect. Rather, measures of older adult abuse and exploitation used in the research literature emphasize specific property, money, or resources being taken. Two composites are used to illustrate exploitation of older adults’ residences by trusted others on whom the older adults depended with potentially serious implications for environmental safety and ultimately the older adults’ housing stability. As part of a larger study on older adult maltreatment, police reports were coded for abuse and financial exploitation as well as misuse of the older adult’s residence that threatened the older adult’s housing security and/or exerted control over the older adult. Nearly one in ten (9.2%) police reports involving older adult victims and known/trusted perpetrators described exploitation of residences. Residence exploitation was separable from financial exploitation and less likely to co-occur with neglect. Considering the importance of housing stability to older adult well-being, consequences of maltreatment by a known/trusted other, and a national housing crisis, we propose that exploitation of older adults’ residences warrants further measurement and practice attention. Findings are relevant to advancing theory in older adult maltreatment (e.g., application of white-collar crime versus betrayal trauma and family violence theories).","Exploring an Emerging Measurement Issue in Older Adult Maltreatment: Exploitation of Older Adults’ Residences Despite nationwide housing challenges that might lead to the exploitation of older adults’ housing resources, exploitation of older adults’ residences has not been a focus of measurement in the rapidly developing field of elder abuse and neglect.

Male and female participants (N = 169, 95 females) read an overmedication civil or criminal trial summary involving a male or female victim. Participants were more likely to make pro-victim trial judgments (e.g. Plaintiff decision) when the trial was presented in civil court compared to criminal court. Additionally, victim and defendant credibility mediated the relationship between trial type and outcome. Civil trials led to enhanced victim credibility and weakened defendant credibility, which then led to more pro-victim trial judgments. Finally, participants who had positive experiences with elders exhibited greater sympathy for the victim and perceived them as more credible. We discuss these results in terms of the legal implications of bringing cases of elder overmedication to court.","Elder neglect in civil versus criminal court: Legal decision-making in cases of overmedication Despite recent increases in reported cases of elder overmedication, there is little research investigating the perception of elder overmedication in the courtroom.

L. Simone; A. Wettstein; O. Senn; T. Rosemann; S. Hasler,2016,medical,English,Types of abuse and risk factors associated with elder abuse,"Detecting elder abuse is challenging because it is a taboo, and many cases remain unreported. This study aimed to identify types of elder abuse and to investigate its associated risk factors. Retrospective analyses of 903 dossiers created at an Independent Complaints Authority for Old Age in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, from January 1, 2008 to October 31, 2012. Characteristics of victims and perpetrators, types of abuse, and associated risk factors related to the victim or the perpetrator were assessed. Bi- and multivariate analysis were used to identify abuse and neglect determinants. A total of 150 cases reflected at least one form of elder abuse or neglect; 104 cases were categorised as abuse with at least one type of abuse (overall 135 mentions), 46 cases were categorised as neglect (active or passive). Psychological abuse was the most reported form (47%), followed by financial (35%), physical (30%) and anticonstitutional abuse (18%). In 81% of the 150 cases at least two risk factors existed. In 13% no associated risk factor could be identified. Compared with neglect, elders with abuse were less likely to be a nursing home resident than living at home (odds ratio [OR] 0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00–0.19). In addition, they were more likely to be cohabiting with their perpetrators (OR 18.01, 95% CI 4.43–73.19). For the majority of the reported elder abuse cases at least two associated risk factors could be identified. Knowledge about these red flags and a multifaceted strategy are needed to identify and prevent elder abuse.","Types of abuse and risk factors associated with elder abuse Detecting elder abuse is challenging because it is a taboo, and many cases remain unreported.

We submitted Freedom of Information requests to English Local Authorities to identify DHRs where victim, perpetrator or both were aged over 60. Collected Reports and/or Executive Summaries were thematically analysed. Analysis identified four key themes in the context of the key relationship and caring: major mental illness of the perpetrator; drug and/or alcohol abuse; financial issues; and a history of domestic abuse in key or family relationships. We analysed 14 adult family homicides, 16 intimate partner homicides and five homicide–suicides. Age per se did not emerge as a significant factor in our analysis.

Riviello,2023,medical,English,Violence and Abuse: A Pandemic Within a Pandemic,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, as society struggled with increasing disease burden, economic hardships, and with disease morbidity and mortality, governments and institutions began implementing stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders to help stop the spread of the virus. Although well-intentioned, one unintended adverse consequence was an increase in violence, abuse, and neglect. We reviewed the literature on the effect the pandemic had on domestic violence, child and elder abuse and neglect, human trafficking, and gun violence. In this paper we explore common themes and causes of this violence and offer suggestions to help mitigate risk during ongoing and future pandemics. Just as these forms of violence primarily target at-risk, vulnerable populations, so did pandemic-related violence target marginalized populations including women, children, Blacks, and those with lower socioeconomic status. This became, and remains, a public health crisis within a crisis. In early 2021, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Public Health and Injury Committee was tasked with reviewing the impact the pandemic had on violence and abuse as the result of a resolution passed at the 2020 ACEP Council meeting. Measures meant to help control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had many unintended consequences and placed people at risk for violence. Emergency departments (ED), although stressed and strained during the pandemic, remain a safety net for survivors of violence. As we move out of this pandemic, hospitals and EDs need to focus on steps that can be taken to ensure they preserve and expand their ability to assist victims should another pandemic or global health crisis develop.","Violence and Abuse: A Pandemic Within a Pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, as society struggled with increasing disease burden, economic hardships, and with disease morbidity and mortality, governments and institutions began implementing stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders to help stop the spread of the virus.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has experience screening for, and resources to respond to, other forms of interpersonal violence and may provide valuable insights into approaches for EA screening. Describe EA screening practices across a national integrated healthcare system serving a large population of older adults at risk for EA. Survey of all 139 VHA medical centers from January to August 2021. Surveys were completed by the Social Work Chief, or delegate, at each site. The survey assessed the presence and characteristics of EA-specific screening practices as well as general abuse/neglect screening conducted with patients of all ages, including older adults. Follow-up emails were sent to sites that reported screening requesting additional details not included in the initial survey. Overall, 130 sites (94%) responded. Among respondents, 5 (4%) reported screening older adults for EA using a previously published tool, while 6 (5%) reported screening for EA with an unstudied or locally developed tool. Forty-eight percent reported screening patients of all ages for general abuse/neglect using unstudied questions/tools, and 44% reported no EA screening at their site. Characteristics of screening programs (e.g., frequency, clinical setting, provider type) varied widely between sites, as did respondents’ understanding of the definition of screening. High variability in screening practices for abuse/neglect and lack of EA-specific screening in a system that has successfully deployed other standardized screening approaches present an important opportunity to standardize and improve EA detection practices. Lessons learned in VHA could help advance the evidence base for EA screening more broadly to increase overall detection rates for EA nationally.","Screening for Elder Abuse in the Veterans Health Administration: Varied Approaches Across a National Health System Elder abuse (EA) is common and has devastating health consequences yet is rarely detected by healthcare professionals.

To investigate the associations between these constructs and to explore the possible mediating role of loneliness in the relationship between EA and depressive symptoms in a representative sample of older Mexican people. A representative community-dwelling survey of older adults aged 60 and older was conducted in two cities in Mexico (Mexico City and Xalapa) in 2018–2019. Measurements of EA, loneliness, depressive symptoms, health, and sociodemographic data were collected. Regression and mediation models were tested to analyze the associations between these variables. The prevalence of EA was 16.3%, loneliness was 50%, and depressive symptoms were 25.5%. The odds ratio (OR) for the occurrence of depressive symptoms was 2.7 when the combined effects of EA and loneliness were considered. The proportion of the effect that could explain the mediating role of loneliness was 31%. To effectively reduce depressive symptoms in older individuals affected by emotional or psychological abuse and neglect, it is crucial to address both the mediating influence of loneliness and EA itself in therapeutic and preventive interventions.","Elder Abuse and Depressive Symptoms: The Mediating Role of Loneliness in Older Adults Elder abuse (EA), depressive symptoms, and loneliness represent a growing risk to the health, well-being, and premature mortality of older adults.

A two‐year prospective cohort study among rural older adults,"Elder abuse and neglect (EAN) is a growing public health problem, and numerous adverse health effects of abuse in late life have been documented. Little is known, however, about the impact of elder abuse on sleep quality. This study examines the longitudinal relationship between EAN and sleep quality. This was a 2-year prospective cohort study involving 1927 older adults in a rural Malaysian district, Kuala Pilah. A multi-stage cluster sampling strategy was employed. After 2 years, 1189 respondents were re-assessed. EAN was determined using the modified Conflict Tactic Scale, while sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The prevalence of elder abuse was 8.1% (95% CI:6.9,9.3). Longitudinal analysis using generalized estimating equations showed that elder abuse contributed to higher PSQI scores (B:0.49, 95% CI:0.17,0.58). Sub-analyses demonstrated that psychological abuse and neglect had significant longitudinal relationships with increase of PSQI scores, while other subtypes did not. Abuse in late life, particularly psychological abuse and neglect, result in greater PSQI scores. Even though this may imply decline in sleep quality, our findings were not considered clinically significant as they did not exceed the clinical cut-off score of five. Nevertheless, sleep quality is an important determinant of health and a predictor of mortality among older adults; thus, understanding its relationship with abuse is useful to health care providers and policy-makers in improving health services and upgrading preventive measures.","Does abuse in late life worsen sleep quality? A two‐year prospective cohort study among rural older adults Elder abuse and neglect (EAN) is a growing public health problem, and numerous adverse health effects of abuse in late life have been documented. Little is known, however, about the impact of elder abuse on sleep quality. This study examines the longitudinal relationship between EAN and sleep quality. This was a 2-year prospective cohort study involving 1927 older adults in a rural Malaysian district, Kuala Pilah. A multi-stage cluster sampling strategy was employed. After 2 years, 1189 respondents were re-assessed. EAN was determined using the modified Conflict Tactic Scale, while sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The prevalence of elder abuse was 8.1% (95% CI:6.9,9.3). Longitudinal analysis using generalized estimating equations showed that elder abuse contributed to higher PSQI scores (B:0.49, 95% CI:0.17,0.58).

This may be partially attributed to low incidence of reporting among emergency medical technicians’ (EMTs), despite state-mandated reporting of suspected elder abuse. Innovative solutions are needed to address under-reporting. The objective was to describe EMTs’ experience detecting and reporting elder abuse. Qualitative data were collected from 11 EMTs and 12 Adult Protective Services (APS) caseworkers that participated in one of five semi-structured focus groups. Focus group data were iteratively coded by two coders. Findings suggest a number of barriers prevent EMTs from reporting elder abuse to APS. Participants suggested that limited training on elder abuse detection or reporting has been provided to them. EMTs suggested that training, creation of an automated reporting system or brief screening tool could be used to enhance EMT’s ability to detect and communicate suspected cases of elder abuse to APS. Results from the present study suggest that EMTs may be uniquely situated to serve as elder abuse and neglect surveillance personnel. EMTs are eager to work with APS to address the under-reporting of elder abuse and neglect, but training is minimal and current reporting procedures are time-prohibitive given their primary role as emergency healthcare providers. Future studies should seek to translate these findings into practice by identifying specific indicators predictive of elder abuse and neglect for inclusion on an automated reporting instrument for EMTs.","Barriers in detecting elder abuse among emergency medical technicians Elder abuse and neglect are highly under-reported in the United States.

Kozina,2019,health/care,English,Contrasting vantage points between caregivers and residents on the perception of elder abuse and neglect during long-term care,"Elder abuse and neglect can be defined as refusing or failing to fulfil a caregiver's obligation to meet the needs of elderly individuals in order to punish or hurt them. We aimed to explore perceptions of elder mistreatment of both caregivers and residents during long-term care, and highlight significant differences in the overall mistreatment perception regarding sociodemographic variables, as well as the type of care facility. The study involved 171 caregivers and 245 elderly individuals in stationary facilities. Two structured questionnaires were used - one for caregivers and the other for institutionalized elderly residents, whose initial validation concerning question and factor selection has been based upon exploratory factor analysis and discriminant validity. Parametric and nonparametric tests were employed in the statistical analysis, and statistical significance was set at p<0.05 (two-sided). We found significant differences in the perception of elder abuse and neglect between caregivers and elderly residents. More specifically, caregivers tend to recognize unnecessary or inappropriate medical/care procedures as indicators of elder mistreatment, while the elderly residents emphasize the removal of their personal belongings and inappropriate physical contact. According to the care facility, residents reported abuse/neglect more frequently in extended care units (21.4%), compared to the county-owned nursing home (11.4%) and private nursing home (12.1%) (p=0.001). Similarly, caregivers reported abuse/neglect more frequently in extended care units (75.4%), in comparison to county-owned nursing home (24.6%) and private nursing home(0%) (p=0.039). Shift work was also a significant predictor, as the morning nursing staff perceived abuse/neglect more frequently(p=0.011). This study has shown that residents and caregivers have contrasting vantage points in relation to elder abuse/neglect perception, which underlines the need for evidence-based standardization of procedures to prevent any type of elder mistreatment.

A systematic review on the efficacy of community-based elder abuse interventions was undertaken to advance the state of knowledge in the field. The peer-reviewed literature between 2009 and December 2015 were searched across four databases. Two raters independently reviewed all articles, assessed their methodological quality, and used a modified Sackett Scale to assign levels of evidence. Four thousand nine hundred and five articles were identified; nine were selected for inclusion. Although there was Level-1 evidence for psychological interventions (n = 2), only one study on strategies for relatives (START) led to a reported decrease in elder abuse. There was Level-4 evidence for conservatorship, an elder abuse intervention/prevention program (ECARE), and a multidisciplinary intervention (n = 4), in which one study yielded significant decreases in elder abuse and/or neglect. The remaining three were classified as Level-5 evidence (n = 3) for elder mediation and multidisciplinary interventions. There are limited studies with high levels of evidence for interventions that decrease elder abuse and neglect.

"Yalçın Gürsoy, Melike; Uçan Yamaç, Sabriye",2024,health/care,English,"Elder abuse, depression, anxiety, and stress in community‐dwelling older adults","Elder abuse as an important public health issue is associated in the literature with various physical and psychological symptoms. The aim of the study is to determine the relationship between elder abuse and depression, anxiety, and stress in the elderly living in the community. The cross-sectional study was completed with 729 older people. Data were collected through a face-to-face interview and a survey form. The Geriatric Mistreatment Scale (GMS) was used to evaluate elder abuse and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between elder abuse and depression, anxiety, and stress. Of the participants, 20.9% were exposed to at least one type of abuse, 9.2% experienced physical abuse, 18.2% experienced psychological abuse, 4.4% experienced neglect, and 7.0% had financial abuse. The general prevalence of moderate to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress among the elderly was respectively 17.1%, 16%, and 10%. As a result of multivariate analysis it was determined that neglect (t = 6245; ß = 4952) and economic abuse (t = 3865; ß = 3350) had statistically significant effects on depression; psychological abuse (t = 2924; ß = 0,992), economic abuse (t = 3127; ß = 3517) and neglect (t = 5913; ß = 4810) had statistically significant effects on anxiety, while psychological (t = 5023; ß = 1756) and economic abuse (t = 5719; ß = 5238) had statistically significant effects on stress (P < 0.05). As a result of the study, it was seen that the prevalence of abuse and depression, anxiety, and stress was high in the elderly. There was also a strong relationship between types of elder abuse and depression, anxiety, and stress. It is recommended that health professionals working with older people to screen them for types of abuse and mental symptoms with the help of appropriate screening tools.","Elder abuse, depression, anxiety, and stress in community‐dwelling older adults Elder abuse as an important public health issue is associated in the literature with various physical and psychological symptoms.

Non-fatal injury reporting is limited to those collected from emergency department visits only, and under-reporting of abuse.1,4,15 It has been reported that only 1 in 24 cases of elder abuse are actually reported to authorities.4 Elder abuse is often perpetrated by the family members, caregivers, financial advisors, or other individuals trusted by the older person. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been stay-at-home orders enacted throughout the country, confining older adults to their homes, potentially increasing their risk. These stay-at-home orders have also decreased social interactions, and social isolation is a known risk factor for elder abuse. During the pandemic, many visits to physicians have been canceled, delayed, or moved to telehealth; however, visits to pharmacies remained essential.

This systematic literature review aimed to synthesize the available findings regarding victims’ help-seeking behavior to inform practice, understand the limits of the evidence, and identify research gaps. A comprehensive search of published and unpublished literature was undertaken, and studies were included if they addressed help-seeking behavior from the perspective of elder abuse victims aged 60 and older. A total of 19 studies met inclusion criteria for review. Findings are presented as a narrative synthesis organized according to help-seeking barriers, facilitators, sources of help, the responses of others, and the characteristics of victims more likely to seek help. Although barriers and sources of help received detailed attention across all studies, findings regarding victim characteristics and facilitators for and responses to help-seeking were limited. The results suggest that there are many barriers to help-seeking and that some victims only seek help when the abuse is perceived as unbearable or they fear for their safety. Results are discussed in relation to implications for intervention, including suggestions to enhance help-seeking behavior. Future research should identify facilitators of help-seeking among victims of elder abuse and victim characteristics associated with early disclosure.

"Fowler, Jennifer",2019,social science,English,Preparing psychology doctorate students to identify and report suspected elder abuse: Evaluating the effectiveness of elder abuse training,"Elder abuse has serious consequences for the physical and mental well being of older adults and often goes underreported (Roberto, 2016). The population of older adults is rising sharply with over 6.4 million older adults projected to be living in California by 2025 (State of California Justice Department, 2009). Given that medical and mental health professionals are mandated reporters of elder abuse, it will be imperative that psychologists understand their role in identifying and reporting suspected elder abuse. Indeed the literature suggests that mental health and healthcare professionals alike are often not adequately prepared to identify, prevent or respond to elder abuse and neglect (Allan, 2005). This quasi-experimental study investigated the effectiveness of an Elder Abuse and Mandated Reporting training for psychology doctoral students that were developed by the California Department of Justice Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse. The sample consisted of 40 (34 women and 6 men) second-year doctoral students at a professional school of psychology in Berkeley, CA. The training was held during their Lifespan Development class. Students participated in a two-hour training that included didactic, experiential and video elements. The researcher presented the training and participants completed two pre- and post-test measures. The first measure was a multiple-choice test prepared by the curriculum developers and the second was a vignette-based measure entitled the Knowledge and Management of Abuse (KAMA) developed for medical professionals being trained in elder abuse in the UK. Posttest scores on both measures were significantly improved over pre test scores at the end of the workshop. Future research in this area might recruit a larger sample of psychology graduate students from multiple schools in California and include a follow up measure one to three months after the end of the workshop to see if results of the workshop are sustained. Combining this didactic training with ongoing live supervision for students working with older adults might also further strengthen knowledge in the area of elder abuse and provides opportunities for application of the workshop material.","Preparing psychology doctorate students to identify and report suspected elder abuse: Evaluating the effectiveness of elder abuse training Elder abuse has serious consequences for the physical and mental well being of older adults and often goes underreported (Roberto, 2016).

"Chang, E-Shien;Levy, Becca R.",2021,social science,English,Protective effects of neighborhood community factors on elder abuse in India,"Elder abuse impacts one in six older persons globally. Most studies of elder abuse have focused on risk factors rather than protective factors, individual-level factors rather than structural factors, and developed countries rather than developing countries where resources are scarce. The current study addressed these gaps by examining whether neighborhood social cohesion and physical order could be such structural-level protective factors for older persons in India. Our cohort consisted of 541 participants aged 60 and over in the pilot wave of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India. We found that older persons with high neighborhood social cohesion were 38% less likely to experience abuse compared to older persons with low cohesion (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.39–0.99). Similarly, participants with high neighborhood physical order were 48% less likely to experience abuse compared to older persons with low physical order (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.32–0.83). Both models adjusted for relevant covariates. Policies supporting greater cohesion and order in communities could reap significant health benefits for older persons.","Protective effects of neighborhood community factors on elder abuse in India Elder abuse impacts one in six older persons globally.

S. Saga; L. E. Blekken; S. Nakrem; A. Sandmoe,2021,health/care,English,Relatives’ experiences with abuse and neglect in Norwegian nursing homes. A qualitative study,"Elder abuse in nursing homes (NH) is a widespread and complex problem. Residents’ ability to share their experiences are impeded, due to a high degree of cognitive problems and frailty, and previous studies are thus mainly based on reports from staff. Therefore, we aimed to give voice to the residents by investigating their relatives’ experiences with elder abuse in NH. Qualitative individual interviews were conducted with 16 relatives of residents with experience of abuse and/or neglect in NH. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Relatives perceived neglect as most pervasive and staff-to-resident psychological abuse as a key problem. Physical abuse was mostly related to resident-to-resident aggression. Relatives perceived elder abuse in NH to be related to low competence among staff, low staffing, poor NH leadership, working cultures characterized by fear and loyalty to employer or co-workers, and a lack of individualized care for the residents. Furthermore, relatives themselves experienced maltreatment from NH, which caused them to suffer stress, anxiety and distrust. Relatives also expressed a need to compensate for lack of care. Relatives of NH residents who had experienced abuse reported that neglect of basic care and individual rights was predominant and viewed organizational explanations as most important. Relatives perceive themselves as collaborators in care and are emotionally attached to their family member. Therefore, if relatives experience resident abuse or neglect, it inflicts a feeling of being mistreated themselves, particularly if they are not listened to or their notice of abuse on the part of the resident is ignored or trivialized. Including relatives in a committed partnership with NH in care practices is not only a valuable path to reduce the risk of abuse, but it also leads to a more sustainable healthcare with high standards of quality and safety.","Relatives’ experiences with abuse and neglect in Norwegian nursing homes.

Including relatives in a committed partnership with NH in care practices is not only a valuable path to reduce the risk of abuse, but it also leads to a more sustainable healthcare with high standards of quality and safety.",relatives experiences abuse neglect norwegian nursing homes qualitative study elder abuse nursing homes nh widespread complex problem residents ability share experiences impeded high degree cognitive problems frailty previous studies mainly based reports staff aimed voice residents investigating relatives experiences elder abuse nh qualitative individual interviews conducted 16 relatives residents experience abuse andor neglect nh content analysis analyse data relatives perceived neglect pervasive stafftoresident psychological abuse key problem physical abuse related residenttoresident aggression relatives perceived elder abuse nh related low competence staff low staffing poor nh leadership working cultures characterized fear loyalty employer coworkers lack individualized care residents furthermore relatives experienced maltreatment nh caused suffer stress anxiety distrust relatives expressed need compensate lack care relatives nh residents experienced abuse reported neglect basic care individual rights predominant viewed organizational explanations important relatives perceive collaborators care emotionally attached family member relatives experience resident abuse neglect inflicts feeling mistreated particularly listened notice abuse resident ignored trivialized including relatives committed partnership nh care practices valuable path reduce risk abuse leads sustainable healthcare high standards quality safety,relatives experiences abuse neglect norwegian nursing homes qualitative study elder abuse nursing homes nh widespread complex problem residents ability share experiences  high degree cognitive problems frailty previous studies mainly based reports staff aimed voice residents investigating relatives experiences elder abuse nh qualitative individual interviews conducted 16 relatives residents experience abuse andor neglect nh content analysis analyse data relatives perceived neglect pervasive stafftoresident psychological abuse key problem physical abuse related residenttoresident aggression relatives perceived elder abuse nh related low competence staff low staffing poor nh leadership working cultures characterized fear   coworkers lack individualized care residents furthermore relatives experienced maltreatment nh caused suffer stress anxiety  relatives expressed need  lack care relatives nh residents experienced abuse reported neglect basic care individual rights predominant viewed organizational explanations important relatives perceive  care emotionally  family member relatives experience resident abuse neglect  feeling mistreated particularly   abuse resident ignored  including relatives committed partnership nh care practices valuable path reduce risk abuse leads sustainable healthcare high standards quality safety,relatives experiences abuse neglect norwegian nursing homes qualitative study elder abuse nursing homes    problem residents   experiences    cognitive problems   studies  based reports staff   residents investigating relatives experiences elder abuse  qualitative  interviews conducted 16 relatives residents experience abuse andor neglect   analysis  data relatives  neglect  stafftoresident psychological abuse  problem  abuse related residenttoresident  relatives  elder abuse  related low  staff low    leadership working      coworkers   care residents  relatives  maltreatment   suffer stress anxiety  relatives  need   care relatives  residents  abuse reported neglect  care  rights     important relatives   care   family  relatives experience resident abuse neglect   mistreated    abuse resident   including relatives  partnership  care practices    risk abuse   healthcare  standards quality

This complex phenomenon is still little understood and studied in Italy. The aim of this study was to explore Italian healthcare professionals’ attitude and barriers toward elder abuse, with a glimpse on the current scenario and evidences to develop an action plan. 42 healthcare professionals filled a questionnaire with 13 open-ended questions, analyzed with a qualitative content analysis. Data were grouped under the following 4 core-themes: description of elder abuse, abuse detection and perception, barriers to reporting, and professional orientation and approach; then they were analyzed to find their central component and discussed jointly. The respondents described physical (64%) and psychological (50%) abuse and neglect (50%) as the three main characteristics of elder abuse; the 59% of them reported at least one experience in detecting or suspecting elder abuse. The 76% of participants believed the report has to be submitted to the Judicial Authority only in presence of compelling evidences. Furthermore, the 73% of the sample perceived that healthcare professionals are the main figures who have to cope with elder abuse, however they did not feel as their exclusive role the assessment of the patients’ potential abuse. Knowledge about elder abuse was limited to physical/psychological issues and, moreover, the legal obligation to report was only poorly known. Imperative is the creation of specific education and training courses, in addition to the need for a multidisciplinary and empathetic approach.","Italian healthcare professionals' attitude and barriers to mandatory reporting of elder abuse: An exploratory study Elder abuse in recent times has reached a remarkable international importance.

This study included N = 1,670 cases of substantiated elder abuse and estimated the 5-year all-cause mortality for five types of elder abuse (caregiver neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial exploitation, and polyvictimization). Statistically significant differences in 5-year mortality risks were found between abuse types and across gender. Caregiver neglect and financial exploitation had the lowest survival rates, underscoring the value of considering the long-term consequences associated with different forms of abuse. Likewise, mortality differences between genders and abuse types indicate the need to consider this interaction in elder abuse case investigations and responses. Further mortality studies are needed in this population to better understand these patterns and implications for public health and clinical management of community-dwelling elder abuse victims.","Five-year all-cause mortality rates across five categories of substantiated elder abuse occurring in the community Elder abuse increases the likelihood of early mortality, but little is known regarding which types of abuse may be resulting in the greatest mortality risk.

"Vilar-Compte, Mireya;Gaitán-Rossi, Pablo",2018,social science,English,Syndemics of severity and frequency of elder abuse: A cross-sectional study in Mexican older females,"Elder abuse is a common phenomenon with important effects on the health and well-being of older adults. There are important gaps in elder abuse measurement, as it is usually reported as the absence or presence of elder abuse, disregarding its severity and frequency. Identify different ways of measuring severity and frequency of elder abuse and assess whether different experiences of severity and frequency suggest syndemic relationships. Through a sample of 534 non-institutionalized Mexican older women, we assessed how severity (i.e., number of abusive experiences and number of types of abuses) and frequency (i.e., if abusive experiences had happened few or many times) correlate among them. For each of these measures we estimated a multinomial model to examine associations with social support, functional impairments, socioeconomic status, food insecurity, depression, and comorbidities, while controlling for key socio-demographic variables. 30.5% of the older women reported psychological abuse, 8.2% financial exploitation, 5.1% caregiver neglect, 3.5% physical abuse, and 1.2% sexual abuse. In terms of frequency, 77.8% of the women self-reported having never been abused or only once in the last 12 months, whereas 13.1% reported abusive experiences repeating few times, and 9.9% repeating many times. In terms of severity, 66.7% of the older women had not been abused, 22.3% had suffered one type of abuse, and 11.1% two or more. Similarly, 15.0% reported one abusive experience, 8.1% two, and 10.3% three or more abusive events during the last 12 months. Severity measures showed similar associations: social support and high socioeconomic level as protective factors among those with less severe abuse, whereas increased depression, food insecurity and functional impairments were associated with more severe experiences of elder abuse. Frequency followed a different pattern, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with those with few experiences (compared to those with none or once), while functional impairments were associated with many experiences of elder abuse. It is relevant to assess elder abuse through its severity and frequency as inter-individual variability and the complexity of the experience shows different determinants suggesting a syndemic approach. This has important clinical and policy implications.","Syndemics of severity and frequency of elder abuse: A cross-sectional study in Mexican older females Elder abuse is a common phenomenon with important effects on the health and well-being of older adults.

Although researchers have begun to identify predisposing risk factors for elder abuse victims and abusers, little is known about the acute precipitants that lead to escalation to physical violence. We analyzed legal records from highly adjudicated cases to describe these acute precipitants for physical elder abuse. In collaboration with a large, urban district attorney’s office, we qualitatively evaluated legal records from 87 successfully prosecuted physical elder abuse cases from 2003 to 2015. We transcribed and analyzed narratives of the events surrounding physical abuse within victim statements, police reports, and prosecutor records. We identified major themes using content analysis. We identified 10 categories of acute precipitants that commonly triggered physical elder abuse, including victim attempting to prevent the abuser from entering or demanding that he or she leave, victim threatening or attempting to leave/escape, threat or perception that the victim would involve the authorities, conflict about a romantic relationship, presence during/intervention in ongoing family violence, issues in multi-generational child rearing, conflict about the abuser’s substance abuse, confrontation about financial exploitation, dispute over theft/destruction of property, and disputes over minor household issues. Common acute precipitants of physical elder abuse may be identified. Improved understanding of these acute precipitants for escalation to physical violence and their contribution to elder abuse may assist in the development of prevention and management strategies.","Acute precipitants of physical elder abuse: Qualitative analysis of legal records from highly adjudicated cases Elder abuse is a common phenomenon with potentially devastating consequences for older adults.

Studies were included if they focused on older people's experience of abuse within residential care settings. A comprehensive data extraction process was employed to identify key themes from the included studies. The initial search yielded a total of 3701 articles of which eight met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed a range of abusive experiences encountered by older people living in residential care settings, including psychological, physical, financial, neglect and sexual abuse. The common attributes of residents vulnerable to abuse were evident throughout each of the studies. Finally, the theme of organizational neglect was apparent through the absence of effective safeguarding measures in the included studies. The findings revealed the insufficient implementation of safeguarding measures increases the risk of abuse among residents. This scoping review highlights the limited research on the experiences of older people who have encountered elder abuse in residential care settings. The findings stress the need for further research exploring the complex interplay of factors contributing to elder abuse within aged care settings.

Intervention research is lacking despite its potential value to victim protection. This study investigates the first and longest-running social work intervention programme for elder abuse in Canada. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the scope of the problem and needs of the population to inform programme development through the recommendations made. One hundred and sixty-four cases of elder abuse reported from January 2012 to April 2014 were examined. Case characteristics and related recommendations are reported. Third parties reported most abuse, which was typically emotional and financial; polyvictimisation was present in most cases. Intake practices that may have facilitated reporting are described and recommendations to improve victim reporting and confidentiality are made. Victim health problems and dependency were common and many victims lacked support. Perpetrators often resided with victims and had mental health and social-functioning problems. Case management varied in length and several barriers were identified. Multi-agency work is recommended to better manage the needs of the victim, risk factors related to the perpetrator and victim–perpetrator cohabitation. Recommendations to improve the safety of the victim and that of professionals are also made.","Reaching out for help: Recommendations for practice based on an in-depth analysis of an elder abuse intervention programme Elder abuse is a growing public health concern with serious and sometimes fatal consequences.

This Note discusses elder abuse while focusing specifically on the occurrence of elder abandonment and how the majority of states do not recognize elder abandonment as a form of elder abuse in their statutes. Moreover, this Note proposes a model statute to be adopted by every state in an effort for elder abandonment to become more widely reported. Elder abandonment is an unfortunate phenomenon and those who contribute to elder abandonment should face criminal liability similar to those abusers who engage in elder neglect or other types of elder abuse.

This comes despite legal and ethical mandates for nursing to report and intervene. A community hospital in the Greater Washington District of Columbia area permitted a Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) student to implement an Elder Abuse screening tool and microlearning quality improvement project. The aim of the project was to utilize a screening tool to augment clinical decision making on suspicions of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Additionally, participants received ten weeks of micorlearnings focused on Elder Abuse topics. The goal of the project was to increase screening and reporting of potential victims of Elder Abuse and increase the knowledge of Registered Nurses. Eight patients were screened for Elder Abuse during the implementation period, with six being reported to Adult Protective Services. From the microlearnings, Registered Nurses reported increased ability to detect abuse, increased confidence in engaging with victims, and supported the utilization of a screening tool. The implication of this project highlighted a strong clinical impact on patient care, despite the low sample size. Each screening and report to Adult Protective Services led to heightened advocacy and facilitated safe care planning.","Implementation of elder abuse screening and microlearnings and its effect on nursing attitudes towards assessment, intervention, and advocacy Elder Abuse is a highly underreported crime that has immense consequences for its victims.

K. Hellwig,2023,medical,English,Elder Abuse: The Hidden Epidemic,"Elder abuse is a major public health problem. Prior to the pandemic, approximately 1 in 10 older adults in the United States experienced elder mistreatment. In 2020, this number doubled to 1 in 5, a nearly 84% increase (Liu, 2022). More distressing is that in almost 60% of elder abuse and neglect cases, a family member is the offender and two-thirds of the perpetrators are adult children or spouses (Nursing Home Justice Team, 2021). Financial abuse is reportedly the fastest-growing form of elder abuse with theft scams at the forefront (Hillendahl, 2022). It is essential that healthcare providers, especially those who care for patients in their homes, understand what elder abuse is, how it can be identified, what conditions may lead to elder abuse, and what home care providers can do to properly intervene when it is suspected that older adults are being abused.","Elder Abuse: The Hidden Epidemic Elder abuse is a major public health problem.

Elder abuse included psychological, physical, and sexual abuse, financial exploitation, and caregiver neglect. The assessments of neuroticism and conscientiousness were derived from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Logistic regression was used. Higher neuroticism (score range: 6–30, OR = 1.14, CI = 1.11–1.18) and lower conscientiousness (score range: 16–60, OR = 0.97, CI = 0.96–0.99) were associated with a higher risk of elder abuse. With respect to different forms of elder abuse, higher neuroticism was associated with an increased risk of psychological abuse (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.10–1.17), financial exploitation (OR = 1.03, CI = 1.00–1.07), and caregiver neglect (OR = 1.06, CI = 1.03–1.09).

This study aims to examine the characteristics of older adults and their family perpetrators that may influence the perceived severity of abuse by older adults using a nationally representative sample among older Koreans. We analyzed 952 community-dwelling older Koreans from a population-based survey of the Survey of Elderly Care and Welfare Need. The analytic sample of this study consisted of older adults who self-reported having been emotionally, physically, and financially abused or neglected by their family members or other primary caregivers. We used multinomial logistic regression models to predict perceived change in severity of abuse. Results showed that the abuse type and duration of abuse were significantly associated with the perceived change in the severity of abuse. Older victims’ age, being female, and being married were also associated with greater risk for increased severity of abuse relative to no change, while older adults’ better health status was associated with lower risk for increased severity of abuse. The findings of this study can help social work professionals identify older adults with heightened risk of abuse and protect the human rights of the most vulnerable aging population.","Exploring Factors Associated with Perceived Changes in Severity of Elder Abuse: A Population-Based Study of Older Adults in Korea Elder abuse is a pressing problem that demands social attention in South Korea.

"Usta, Jinan;El Jarrah, Rana;Kronfol, Nabil;Farver, JoAnn M.",2021,medical,English,Perspectives of elder abuse in Lebanon,"Elder abuse is a preventable problem. Presently, little is known about this phenomenon in Middle Eastern settings. The purpose of this study was to explore elder abuse in Beirut, Lebanon from different stakeholders’ points of view with a focus on identifying behaviors that are considered to be abusive to older adults and predisposing factors. Focus group discussions were carried out with 88 home- and institution-based older adults, their family members and caregivers, and with 49 stakeholders (medical professionals, institution directors, government officials). Results showed that behaviors considered abusive among Lebanese participants were comparable to reports from international studies. The most commonly mentioned risk factors were history of abuse in a seemingly dysfunctional family followed by caregivers’ lack of acceptance of the physical changes that accompany aging. The response to elder abuse requires a multidimensional approach that spans protective policies to increase care providers’ awareness about the physiologic changes of aging as well as concerted efforts to correct misinformation about the hidden problem of elder abuse.","Perspectives of elder abuse in Lebanon Elder abuse is a preventable problem.

M. Gardezi; H. G. Moore; L. E. Rubin; J. N. Grauer,2022,medical,English,Predictors of Physical Abuse in Elder Patients With Fracture,"Elder abuse is a public health issue requiring attention. Unlike abuse in the pediatric population, predictors of elder abuse in patients with fracture have not been well defined. Elderly patients with physical abuse and fracture were abstracted using the 2007 to 2017 National Emergency Department Sample database. Univariate comparisons, multivariate regression, and adjusted odds ratios were used to determine independent predictors of elder abuse compared with nonabuse fracture controls. Thirteen percent of elder physical abuse patients presenting to the emergency department had fracture. Of all patients with fracture, elder abuse patients tended to be younger; be female; belong to lower income quartiles; and have codiagnoses of volume depletion, mental disorders, dementia, and intellectual disability. Presentation with other forms of elder abuse, such as psychological abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse, and multiple fractures were also associated with elder physical abuse. Multivariate regression found elder abuse to be more likely in the setting of skull and rib fractures and less likely in the setting of femur and foot and ankle fractures. This study identified predictors of elder physical abuse in fracture patients older than 60 years. As with pediatric abuse, heightened awareness of potential physical abuse should be considered, especially in higher risk patients.","Predictors of Physical Abuse in Elder Patients With Fracture Elder abuse is a public health issue requiring attention.

Malmedal,2021,health/care,English,Factors associated with staff-to-resident abuse in Norwegian nursing homes: a cross-sectional exploratory study,"Elder abuse is a public health problem that is gaining attention due to its serious impacts on people’s health and well-being, and it is predicted to increase along with the world’s rapidly ageing population. Staff-to-resident abuse in nursing homes is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon associated with multiple factors on different levels of the ecological model. This study aimed to explore individual, relational, and institutional characteristics associated with perpetrated staff-to-resident abuse in nursing homes, using a multilevel hierarchical approach. This was a cross-sectional exploratory study of 3693 nursing staff (response rate 60.1%) in 100 randomly selected nursing homes in Norway. We explored the characteristics of nursing staff, their relationship with residents, and institutional features associated with three types of abuse: psychological abuse, physical abuse, and neglect. These were modelled using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analyses. Individual staff factors found to be associated with all three types of abuse were 1) being a registered nurse/social educator (OR 1.77–2.49) or licensed practical nurse (OR 1.64–1.92), 2) reporting symptoms of psychological distress (OR 1.44–1.46), 3) intention to leave the job (OR 1.35–1.40), and 4) reporting poor attitudes towards people with dementia (OR 1.02–1.15). Also, staff who reported poorer quality of childhood were more likely to perpetrate neglect (OR 1.14). Relational factors such as care-related conflicts (OR 1.97–2.33) and resident aggression (OR 1.36–2.09) were associated with all three types of abuse. Of institutional factors, lack of support from a manager was associated with perpetrating psychological abuse (OR 1.56). We found several predictors of staff-to-resident abuse on different levels of the ecological model, which underlines the importance of using a multifaceted approach to identify risk factors of elder abuse in nursing homes. However, future studies should explore the underlying mechanism and causes with a prospective or qualitative design and target the multifaceted nature of risk factors when designing preventive interventions.","Factors associated with staff-to-resident abuse in Norwegian nursing homes: a cross-sectional exploratory study Elder abuse is a public health problem that is gaining attention due to its serious impacts on people’s health and well-being, and it is predicted to increase along with the world’s rapidly ageing population.

Persons with dementia are at higher risk of elder abuse than the older population in general. With a high and increasing prevalence of dementia this issue cannot be neglected. Hence, the aims of this study were 1) to describe the proportion of abusive episodes among home-dwelling persons with dementia and their informal caregivers, and 2) to explore differences between informal caregivers who have reported committing and not committing abusive acts. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among informal caregivers of home-dwelling persons with dementia in Norway from May to December 2021 with a total of 549 participants. Two-thirds of informal caregivers had committed at least one abusive episode toward the person with dementia in the past year (63.5% psychological abuse, 9.4% physical abuse, 3.9% financial abuse, 2.4% sexual abuse, 6.5% neglect). One-third of informal caregivers had experienced aggression from the person with dementia (33.9% psychological abuse, 7.8% physical abuse, 1.1% financial abuse, 1.4% sexual abuse). Tests for independence showed that the risk of abusive episodes from informal caregivers toward persons with dementia was higher when the informal caregiver was a spouse/partner of the person with dementia and if they experienced aggression from the person with dementia. The results demonstrate that a majority of informal caregivers commit some form of abusive episodes, and episodes that fall within the scope of psychological abuse are most frequent. This study expands knowledge about elder abuse among home-dwelling persons with dementia. Increased understanding of the dynamics of abuse is essential to be able to reduce risk and prevent abuse.","Abusive episodes among home-dwelling persons with dementia and their informal caregivers: a cross-sectional Norwegian study Elder abuse is a serious issue with a global prevalence of 15.7% in the community setting.

The present study aimed to identify and describe the abuse of hospitalized elders from the perspective of patients and their family members. The present exploratory qualitative study was conducted from October 2017 to September 2018 at six different teaching hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. The target population was elderly patients in different wards across various hospitals and their family members. Based on the purposive sampling method, 16 hospitalized elderly patients and 11 family members were recruited and interviewed. The data were analyzed using the inductive content analysis method in accordance with the process described by Elo and Kyngas (J Adv Nurs 62:107–15, 2008). Based on the analysis of the interview data, four main categories were extracted and classified as Micro-level, Meso-level, Exo-level, and Macro-level issues.

"Reges, Maureen Louise",2023,health/care,English,Forensic nurse identification of elder abuse: Implementing the elder assessment instrument,"Elder abuse is a significant public health concern and is thought to be largely underrecognized. The Centers for Disease Control estimates 1 in 10 older adults, aged 60 years old and over, who live independently were abused the previous year. The National Council on Aging estimates up to 5 million older Americans are abused every year. Poor detection in the hospital of elder abuse (EA) can have profound health consequences. Systematic reviews suggest benefits of utilizing valid screening tools for EA such as the Elder Assessment Instrument (EAI). Jean Watson’s Theory of Human Caring provided the conceptual underpinning of the project as forensic nurses assist their older patients to meet their basic human needs of safety while offering support in a helping-trust relationship. The clinical question guiding this project is whether using the EAI for patients aged 60 years old and over for possible abuse by forensic nurses, improves identification of EA over a three-month time frame. Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence Based Practice model guided the project, which describe several cornerstones of nursing practice, education, and research. Pre-intervention (N=18) participants who were suspected abused by initial screening question, were referred to a forensic nurse for assessment using no specific method to identify abuse. Post-intervention (N=9) participants were referred to a forensic nurse and assessed using the EAI. Data analysis demonstrated improved identification in all four areas of abuse.

Hairi,2020,health/care,English,Elder abuse: Nationwide findings among community-dwelling Malaysian older persons,"Elder abuse is a significant public health problem. This study aims to estimate its prevalence and associated factors, using representative national Malaysian data. A nationwide population-based survey involving 3977 community-dwelling older persons aged ≥60 years was conducted via face-to-face interview, of whom 3466 older persons were eligible for screening using a locally validated tool. Elder abuse was defined as any one occurrence of neglect, financial, psychological, physical or sexual abuse perpetrated by someone in a position of trust that was experienced in the past 12 months. About 9.0% of older persons in Malaysia have experienced elder abuse in the past 12 months, with neglect being the commonest type experienced (7.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54, 10.07). There is no significant difference by age group and geographical location. Males (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.7; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.60), poorer social support (aOR 5.0; 95% CI: 2.25, 11.22), dependency in activities of daily living (aOR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.23, 3.44) and a previous history of abuse (aOR 10.1; 95% CI: 4.50, 22.86) show higher odds of experiencing elder abuse. Almost 5% of abused older persons reported experiencing multiple types of abuse. Reporting is low at 19.3% with none reporting to healthcare personnel. The prevalence of elder abuse in this study is lower than global estimates, but similar to local studies. Preventive measures and programs are crucial to overcoming elder abuse and need to be carried out at multiple levels – the individual, community, healthcare and other stakeholders.","Elder abuse: Nationwide findings among community-dwelling Malaysian older persons Elder abuse is a significant public health problem.

In the last three decades, there is responsiveness toward abuse of children and spouses worldwide but even today abuse and neglect of aged people seem to be the matter of least concern. This study aims to reveal the magnitude of elder abuse and its predictors. This is a cross-sectional study carried out in a community setting among elderly people (60 years and older) from October 2015 to September 2017 in a rural area of West Bengal, eastern part of India. Elder abuse was elicited by questions adapted from the Actual Abuse Tool. Data were analysed using SPSS (version 16.0). Logistic regression analysis was performed to reveal the factors associated with elder abuse. The study found that 25.6% of the respondents had experienced abuse, psychological abuse being the commonest type. Disability was the most common perceived risk for abuse. Univariate logistic regression showed higher age (70 years and older), female gender, who were Scheduled caste, living in a nuclear family, having more than three children, financially and functionally dependent, who was suffering from depression and multimorbidity had increased odds of being abused. In multivariable logistic regression, people aged above 70 years, living in a nuclear family and dependent for instrumental activities of daily living remained significant predictors of abuse. Around one in four of the respondents was abused in a 1 year duration which implies the urgent need for action. Routine screening for elder abuse at ground level and abuse prevention campaigns can be an important measure to alleviate this hidden problem. Also, there is a need to explore culturally specific forms of elder abuse to provide an age-friendly environment.","Elder abuse and its predictors: A cross‐sectional study in a rural area of West Bengal, eastern part of India Elder abuse is an important public health problem hidden from public view in spite of its detrimental effect on physical and mental health.

The present study was aimed to determine the rate of domestic abuse and its relationship with demographic characteristics among elderly people referred to Primary Health Care (PHC) centers in Shiraz, Iran, 2018. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 older people aged 60 years old and above who referred to 22 PHC centers of Shiraz. The data were collected using demographic characteristics questionnaire, Katz index, the domestic elder abuse questionnaire, and elder neglect checklist through face-to-face interview and observation methods. Backward linear regression model was used for analyzing the data. The results indicated that 52.5% of the participants were female and 51.8% aged 60–69 years old. A total of 159 cases (39.8%) reflected at least one form of elder abuse or neglect. The results indicated that 21% of the participants (n = 84) were abused by their own children. Care neglect was the most reported form (42.8%), followed by psychological abuse (41.3%), emotional neglect (38.8%), and financial abuse (34.3%). The most common types of neglect were motion limitations (25%) followed by the dental problems (23.8%). The results also showed a significant relationship between domestic elder abuse and level of income (p = 0.017), having a house (p = 0.028), type of perpetrator (< 0.001), and insurance status (p = 0.027). The results revealed a considerable rate of domestic abuse against elderly people, causing a serious risk for their health and security.","Screening for domestic abuse and its relationship with demographic variables among elderly individuals referred to primary health care centers of Shiraz in 2018 Elder abuse is an important public health problem.

Patients were eligible if they were ≥ 65 years old, oriented to time, and with a Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale score 3, 4 or 5. In a private setting, participants were questioned directly about abuse as part of a larger questionnaire exploring ten non-medical problems. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of elder abuse. A total of 1061 participants were recruited (mean age: 77.1 (SD 7.6) years, female sex: 55.7%, lived alone: 42.5%). Patients mostly attended EDs for pain (19.6%), neurologic (11.3%) or cardiovascular (8.4%) symptoms. The most frequent pre-existing comorbidities were hypertension (67.2%), mental health conditions (33.3%) and cardiac insufficiency (29.6%). Mobility issues outside (41.0%) or inside their home (30.7%) and loneliness (29.4%) were also frequent. Fifty-four (5.1%) participants reported elder abuse, of which 34.3% were aware of available community-based resources. Identified predictors of elder abuse were female sex (OR 2.8 [95%CI 1.4; 5.6]), financial difficulties (OR 3.6 [95%CI 1.8; 7.3]), food insecurity (OR 2.7 [95%CI 1.2; 5.6]), need for a caregiver (OR 2.7 [95%CI 1.5; 5.0]) and at least one pre-existing mental health condition (OR 2.6 [95%CI 1.4; 4.9]). When questioned directly, 5.1% of older adults attending EDs reported experiencing abuse.

The literature reports that one elderly person out of six is a potential victim. To analyse cases reported to the judicial authorities in the territory of Genoa in the period 2010–2019, to investigate the features of elder abuse, to assess the trend of this phenomenon and to propose preventive strategies. We analysed the data on reports of abuse passed by the Court of Genoa in the period 2015–2019 concerning physical and mental maltreatment, abandonment and financial exploitation of elderly subjects. These data were compared with those recorded in the previous 5-year period and in the literature. In the period 2015–2019, 156 cases of elder abuse were identified (versus 63 in the previous period): 18 cases of domestic violence, 5 cases of abuse of the means of correction, 18 cases of caregiver neglect, 76 cases of physical injury and 39 cases of financial exploitation. Abuse was seen to be perpetrated most frequently in the domestic setting and by the victims' relatives. The main risk factors were female gender and the victim’s dependence on others, the maltreating subject’s mental illness and substance abuse. We documented a progressive increase in the number of abuses reported to the judicial authority; this reflects greater awareness of the problem. However, our figures remained well below the incidence estimated in the literature. It is necessary to train healthcare personnel to identify and manage cases of suspected abuse, and to provide adequate support in situations at risk.","Elder abuse in Europe's ""most elderly"" city: an update of the phenomenon based on the cases reported to the Penal Court of Genoa from 2015 to 2019 and literature review Elder abuse is currently a worldwide problem.

Currently, there are no validated or culturally adapted screening measures for elder abuse in South Africa. The aim of this study was to test the cultural appropriateness of the Elder Abuse Screening Tool (EAST) and the Caregiver Abuse Screen (CASE) in two regions and four languages in South Africa. Using a cognitive interviewing methodology, 23 carers and 19 older adults were interviewed. Findings show that questions in the EAST and CASE are generally well understood, but that adaptations of both tools are necessary for use within South Africa. Fear, knowledge, and experience of crime also showed that strangers, like family, deliberately use deception to build trust and abuse. Further validation is needed to determine suitable scoring and use by health and social care practitioners.","Cross-cultural adaptation of the EAST and CASE screening tools for elder abuse in South Africa Elder abuse is globally considered a hidden problem with great variations in its conceptualization across cultures, non-uniformity in understanding, and manifestations of abuse and neglect.

Health, economical and psychological dimensions of the experience of aging also pose risk for elder abuse. This study aims to determine the abuse to which elder people are exposed based upon their own evaluations and to investigate the risk factors associated with elder abuse. This is a cross-sectional study among quantitative designs. Population of the study comprises 309 outpatient elders over the age of 65 referring to Aydın Doğan Geriatrics Clinic of Ankara University, Turkey. Collected data were analyzed by chi-square test and logistic regression. In total, 70.9% of the elderly participating in this study experienced abuse more than once. Majority of the participants were victims of emotional abuse (64.1%), followed by neglect and abandonment (26.9%) and economic abuse (12.6%). There was significant relation between sex, marital status, health status of the elderly and being abused (p < 0.05). Being female and evaluating health status as bad are risk factors (p < 0.05). Elder abuse is a quite complex and multifaceted social problem. It is expected that this study will increase awareness of helping professionals (social workers, nurses, doctors, counsellors) about elder abuse risk factors and contribute to the development of social policies for preventing elder abuse. For future research, it will be more beneficial if studies on elder abuse adopt a holistic approach that will incorporate the family and relatives of the elderly and institutions.","Elder abuse in Turkey and associated risk factors Elder abuse is one of the most important problems encountered by the elderly.

"Simmons, Johanna;Wenemark, Marika;Ludvigsson, Mikael",2021,health/care,English,"Development and validation of REAGERA-P, a new questionnaire to evaluate health care provider preparedness to identify and manage elder abuse","Elder abuse is prevalent and associated with morbidity but often goes unnoticed in health care. Research on the health care response to victims calls for valid measurements. This article describes the development and validation of a questionnaire to evaluate health care provider preparedness to care for older adults subjected to abuse, the REAGERA-P (Responding to Elder Abuse in GERiAtric Care – Provider questionnaire). REAGERA-P was developed in phase I. The questionnaire includes a case vignette, self-efficacy scales for identifying and managing elder abuse cases and cause for concern as well as organizational barriers when talking with older patients about abuse. Content validity was ensured by a review committee, and cognitive interviews were conducted to ensure face validity and to examine cognitive processes to ensure comprehension. REAGERA-P was then administered to health care providers (n = 154, response rate 99 %) to test for construct validity. Factor analysis was performed, and internal consistency was tested for the self-efficacy scales. Convergent validity was tested by investigating associations between relevant variables. Some items were revised in phase II, and new cognitive interviews were performed. Parts of the questionnaire were tested for responsiveness by administering it to medical interns (n = 31, response rate 80 %) before and after an educational intervention. REAGERA-P showed good content and face validity. The factor analysis revealed two factors: one for asking questions about abuse (Cronbach’s α = 0.75) and one for managing the response to the questions (Cronbach’s α = 0.87). Results suggest good convergent validity for the self-efficacy scales and for questions about cause for concern and organizational barriers. The responsiveness of the self-efficacy scales was good: the mean on the scale for asking questions (range 0–30) was 15.0 before the intervention and 21.5 afterwards, the mean on the scale for managing the response (range 0–50) was 22.4 before the intervention and 32.5 afterwards. REAGERA-P is a new questionnaire that can be used to evaluate health care provider preparedness to identify and manage cases of elder abuse, including educational interventions conducted among staff to improve health care responses to victims of elder abuse. This initial testing of the questionnaire indicates that the REAGERA-P has good validity.","Development and validation of REAGERA-P, a new questionnaire to evaluate health care provider preparedness to identify and manage elder abuse Elder abuse is prevalent and associated with morbidity but often goes unnoticed in health care.

Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity, with study quality assessed with the risk of bias tool. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015029197. Of the 38 544 studies initially identified, 52 were eligible for inclusion. These studies were geographically diverse (28 countries). The pooled prevalence rate for overall elder abuse was 15·7% (95% CI 12·8–19·3). The pooled prevalence estimate was 11·6% (8·1–16·3) for psychological abuse, 6·8% (5·0–9·2) for financial abuse, 4·2% (2·1–8·1) for neglect, 2·6% (1·6–4·4) for physical abuse, and 0·9% (0·6–1·4) for sexual abuse. Meta-analysis of studies that included overall abuse revealed heterogeneity. Significant associations were found between overall prevalence estimates and sample size, income classification, and method of data collection, but not with gender. Although robust prevalence studies are sparse in low-income and middle-income countries, elder abuse seems to affect one in six older adults worldwide, which is roughly 141 million people. Nonetheless, elder abuse is a neglected global public health priority, especially compared with other types of violence.","Elder abuse prevalence in community settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis Elder abuse is recognised worldwide as a serious problem, yet quantitative syntheses of prevalence studies are rare.

S. R. Acharya; B. K. Suman; S. Pahari; Y. C. Shin; D. H. Moon,2021,health/care,English,"Prevalence of abuse among the elderly population of Syangja, Nepal","Elder abuse is recognized as a serious public health concern and top priority aging issues. World Health Organization reported that around 1 out of 6 old people in the world experienced some form of abuse. This study was carried out to find out the prevalence of different forms of abuse among elderly Nepalese people. The cross-sectional, quantitative analytical study was carried out among 373 elders of the Syangja district of Nepal. The study population was selected through simple, proportionate, and systematic sampling methods. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The majority of participants were female (54.5%). The prevalence of elderly abuse was found to be 54.5%. The most common form of abuse among the elderly population was neglect (23.1%), psychological abuse (20.6%), physical abuse (6.5%), financial abuse (2.4%), and sexual abuse (1.9%).

Neglect was found to be the most common form of abuse. The abuse was prevalent among elderly who were ill and with the habit of tobacco and alcohol consumption.","Prevalence of abuse among the elderly population of Syangja, Nepal Elder abuse is recognized as a serious public health concern and top priority aging issues. World Health Organization reported that around 1 out of 6 old people in the world experienced some form of abuse. This study was carried out to find out the prevalence of different forms of abuse among elderly Nepalese people. The cross-sectional, quantitative analytical study was carried out among 373 elders of the Syangja district of Nepal. The study population was selected through simple, proportionate, and systematic sampling methods. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The majority of participants were female (54.5%). The prevalence of elderly abuse was found to be 54.5%. The most common form of abuse among the elderly population was neglect (23.1%), psychological abuse (20.6%), physical abuse (6.5%), financial abuse (2.4%), and sexual abuse (1.9%).

M. Ludvigsson; N. Wiklund; K. Swahnberg; J. Simmons,2022,health/care,English,Experiences of elder abuse: a qualitative study among victims in Sweden,"Elder abuse is underreported and undertreated. Methods for prevention and intervention are being developed, but the knowledge guiding such measures is often insufficiently based on the victims’ own voices due to a paucity of studies. The aim of this study was therefore to explore experiences of elder abuse among the victims themselves. Consecutive inpatients ≥ 65 years of age at a hospital clinic in Sweden were invited to participate, and 24 victims of elder abuse were identified. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted, and transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The analysis generated four themes that together give a comprehensive picture of elder abuse from the participants’ subjective perspectives. The participants’ experiences of abuse were similar to previous third-party descriptions of elder abuse and to descriptions of abuse among younger adults, but certain aspects were substantially different. Vulnerability due to aging and diseases led to dependance on others and reduced autonomy. Rich descriptions were conveyed of neglect, psychological abuse, and other types of abuse in the contexts of both care services and family relations. Elder abuse is often associated with an individual vulnerability mix of the aging body, illnesses, and help dependence in connection with dysfunctional surroundings. As individual differences of vulnerability, exposure to violence, and associated consequences were so clear, this implies that components of prevention and intervention should be individually tailored to match the needs and preferences of older victims.","Experiences of elder abuse: a qualitative study among victims in Sweden Elder abuse is underreported and undertreated.

The purpose of this investigation was to study the effectiveness of Family-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Social Work (FBCBSW) in reducing elder abuse. In a randomized clinical trial in Iran, 27 elders participated in intervention and control groups. The intervention groups received a five-session FBCBSW intervention and completed the Domestic-Elder-Abuse-Questionnaire (DEAQ), which evaluates elder abuse at baseline and follow-ups. Repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Wilcoxon test were used to analyze the data. The repeated measures ANOVA revealed that FBCBSW was successful in reducing elder abuse. The Wilcoxon test indicated that emotional neglect, care neglect, financial neglect, curtailment of personal autonomy, psychological abuse, and financial abuse significantly decreased over time, but there was no statistically significant difference in physical abuse before and after the intervention. The findings from this study suggest that FBCBSW is a promising approach to reducing elder abuse and warrants further study with larger samples.","The effect of a family-based intervention with a cognitive-behavioral approach on elder abuse Elder abuse may become a health issue in developing countries, including Iran.

Using a qualitative descriptive approach, this study generated data through four in-depth interviews (IDIs) and eight focus group discussions (FGDs). All IDIs and FGDs were audiorecorded, transcribed coded and analysed thematically with Atlas ti. Rural and urban communities in Oyo State, southwest Nigeria. 73 purposively selected adults who had provided care for or lived near an older person in southwestern Nigeria. Types of elder abuse identified were verbal (grumbling, insulting, snapping and shouting at older persons), physical (shoving and beating an older person) and neglect (refusing to render assistance, cook or carry out chores for an older person). Participants believed relatives of older persons were unlikely to perpetrate abuse compared with neighbours and paid caregivers. They, however, felt that people whose parents had maltreated them during childhood could perpetrate abuse especially neglect of their older parents. Identified possible provocation for abuse included an unkempt physical appearance, poor attitude or offensive behaviour in the older person. Participants further opined that lack of communal unity or mutual respect, loss of moral ideals and religious values and erosion of cultural values could also provide an environment where elder abuse can thrive. Interventions for community-level prevention of elder abuse can leverage on the identified moral and religious values, relationship and cultural factors for successful deployment.","Insights into caregivers' perspectives on abuse of older persons: a qualitative exploratory study in southwest Nigeria Elder abuse perpetration by caregivers is well documented, particularly from the perspectives of older persons who are victims of abuse.

Triviño-Juárez,2024,medical,English,Prevalence of elder abuse in the community and care settings: An umbrella review,"Elder abuse, an important human rights issue and public health problem, contributes to increased disability and mortality. In the last decades, several reviews have synthesized primary studies to determine its prevalence. This umbrella review aimed to estimate the worldwide overall prevalence rate of elder abuse in the community and care setting. Following prospective registration at PROSPERO (CRD42021281866) we conducted a search of eight electronic databases to identify systematic reviews from inception until 17 January 2023. The corrected covered area was calculated to estimate the potential overlap of primary studies between reviews. The quality of the selected reviews was assessed using a modified AMSTAR-2 instrument. We extracted data on the prevalence of any type of elder (people aged 60 years old or older) abuse in the community and care setting. There were 16 systematic reviews retrieved between 2007 and 2022, out of which ten captured prevalence globally, three in Iran, one in Turkey, one in China and one in Brazil. The 16 reviews included 136 primary studies in total between 1988 and 2020. The overlapping of studies between reviews was found to be moderate (5.5%). The quality of reviews was low (2, 12.5%) or critically low (14, 87.5%). The estimated range of global prevalence of overall elder abuse was wide (1.1–78%), while the estimations of specific abuse prevalence ranged from 0–81.8% for neglect, 1.1–78.9% for psychological abuse, 0.7–78.3% for financial abuse, 0.1–67.7% for physical abuse, and 0–59.2% for sexual abuse. Although the low quality of the evidence and the heterogeneity of the phenomenon makes it hard to give precise prevalence data, it is without a question that elder abuse is a prevalent problem with a wide dispersion. The focus of attention should shift towards interventions and policymaking to prevent this form of abuse.","Prevalence of elder abuse in the community and care settings: An umbrella review Elder abuse, an important human rights issue and public health problem, contributes to increased disability and mortality.

Ninety-six dental students, attending the UTHSC College of Dentistry during the fall semester of 2018, were enrolled. Pre- and post-assessments, designed to assess changes in students’ perceived and actual knowledge, were conducted. Paired sample t-test results indicate that the EAAPET program significantly improved students’ perception of their abilities to identify, respond to, and report elder abuse. Improvement was also demonstrated within students’ actual knowledge of how to appropriately interact with suspected elder abuse victims.

This study evaluates the prevalence of elder polyvictimization among a nationally representative sample of community-residing U.S. older adults. Data from the National Elder Mistreatment Study were examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. Approximately, 1.7% of older adults experienced past-year polyvictimization, for which risk factors included problems accomplishing activities of daily living (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47), low social support (OR = 1.64), and past experience of traumatic events (OR = 4.81).

Yet, no evidence-based intervention models exist that prevent EANF. In this article, we describe the assessment of process outcomes for a Community Complex Care Response Team (C3RT) model developed, via a practitioner–researcher partnership, to reduce instances of EANF victimization among higher risk community-dwelling older adults by identifying and coordinating their service needs. Specifically, we evaluated whether this C3RT approach produced more service coordination among providers (measured as documented interagency communications), more referrals for services, and more enrollment in services. A pragmatic randomized control trial using a 1:1 randomization scheme allocated participants to either the C3RT intervention (N = 74) or standard practice (N = 72) group offered by a local Area Agency on Aging. Outcome data were extracted from the participants' administrative service records. The participants assigned to C3RT had significantly more interagency communications and services provided (p < 0.05) than those in standard practice. Communications and services increased across a broad range of multidisciplinary services, which attend to the social determinants of health. This study is the first to use objective outcome measures to evaluate the processes of a coordinated community response approach systematically.","Pragmatic randomized control trial of a coordinated community response: Increasing access to services for at-risk older adults Elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation (EANF) impacts over five million community-dwelling older adults.

Although services are available to help these victims, they are often fragmented within communities with service providers having limited means to provide preventative services. The coordinated community response (CCR) is a type of coalition intended to overcome siloed services through a single-point-of-entry system and more team-based approaches to prevention. This article describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of the interagency functioning of a local CCR. The main goal of the CCR has been to better serve victims of elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation. However, through the coalition's evolution, the mission of how to do this shifted from a victim service model to a prevention approach. Unique features of this CCR include a uniform consent form to allow sharing of protected client data among all service providers and a technology-supported infrastructure for service record documentation and referrals. Using available data from administrative records, the number of unique interagency referrals for services to older adults at risk increased 450% from 2016 to 2018. The strength and type of connections between agencies changed over time. Among all eligible clients offered services, most (77%) agreed to provide uniform consent to allow data sharing among other local partner agencies. The evaluation showed that the coalition met most of its planned measurable outputs in the original logic model guiding the CCR programmatic development. The evaluation findings and lessons learned inform updated guidelines for self-assessment of CCRs.","Development and implementation of a coordinated community response to address elder abuse and neglect Elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation impacts over five million community-dwelling older adults in the United States.

Findings from the PINE Study,"Elder mistreatment (EM) is a pervasive public health issue and is associated with morbidity and premature mortality. This study aimed to examine how the prevalence of EM and its subtypes vary using different definitions among U.S. Chinese older adults. The Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago is a population-based epidemiological survey of 3,159 U.S. Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area that is guided by a community-based participatory research approach. Participants answered questions regarding psychological, physical, and sexual abuse, caregiver neglect, and financial exploitation. Definitional approaches for EM and its subtypes were constructed from least restrictive to most restrictive. Using different definitional criteria, the prevalence of psychological abuse was 1.1%–9.8%, physical abuse was 1.1%, sexual abuse was 0.2%, caregiver neglect was 4.6%–11.1%, and financial exploitation was 8.8%–9.3%. Overall, EM varied from 13.9% to 25.8%, depending on the defining criteria. Regardless of the definition used, those who experienced EM were more likely to be older and have higher educational attainment, poor health status, poor quality of life, and worsened health change in the last year. However, among the different definitions of overall EM, there were no statistically significant differences across sociodemographic characteristics or self-reported health status associated with EM criteria. Elder mistreatment is prevalent among U.S. Chinese older adults regardless of the definitional criteria. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with EM did not differ by definitional criteria. Future longitudinal studies are needed to quantify the risk and protective factors associated with EM in Chinese aging populations.","Do the definitions of elder mistreatment subtypes matter?

Despite growing recognition of its occurrence, there are no evidence-based primary prevention programs. Although EM is distinct from other areas of family violence, including child maltreatment and intimate partner violence, common risk factors and theoretical underpinnings point to opportunities for prevention strategies. Drawing on evidence-based best practices found in other fields of family violence, we identify approaches that could be tested to prevent EM at the hands of family caregivers, who are among the most likely to commit mistreatment. Specifically, we examine home visiting approaches primarily used in the child maltreatment field and identify components that have potential to inform EM interventions, including prevention. We conclude that there is enough information to begin testing a prevention intervention for EM that targets caregivers.","What Can Elder Mistreatment Researchers Learn About Primary Prevention From Family Violence Intervention Models?

We conclude that there is enough information to begin testing a prevention intervention for EM that targets caregivers.",elder mistreatment researchers learn primary prevention family violence intervention models elder mistreatment em public health problem harms millions older americans year despite growing recognition occurrence evidencebased primary prevention programs em distinct areas family violence including child maltreatment intimate partner violence common risk factors theoretical underpinnings point opportunities prevention strategies drawing evidencebased best practices found fields family violence identify approaches tested prevent em hands family caregivers likely commit mistreatment specifically examine home visiting approaches primarily child maltreatment field identify components potential inform em interventions including prevention conclude information begin testing prevention intervention em targets caregivers,elder mistreatment researchers learn primary prevention family violence intervention models elder mistreatment em public health problem harms millions older americans year despite growing recognition occurrence evidencebased primary prevention programs em distinct areas family violence including child maltreatment intimate partner violence common risk factors theoretical  point opportunities prevention strategies drawing evidencebased best practices found fields family violence identify approaches tested prevent em hands family caregivers likely commit mistreatment specifically examine home visiting approaches primarily child maltreatment field identify components potential inform em interventions including prevention conclude information begin testing prevention intervention em targets caregivers,elder mistreatment researchers   prevention family violence intervention  elder mistreatment   health problem harms millions older americans year despite growing   evidencebased  prevention programs    family violence including child maltreatment  partner violence  risk factors    opportunities prevention strategies  evidencebased  practices   family violence identify      family caregivers   mistreatment  examine home visiting   child maltreatment  identify     interventions including prevention  information  testing prevention intervention   caregivers
"Li, Mengting;Dong, XinQi",2021,health/care,English,Association between different forms of elder mistreatment and cognitive change,"Elder mistreatment (EM) is associated with worse physical health and psychological well-being, but little is known regarding its cognitive consequences. Data were derived from the T1–T2 PINE (n = 2713). EM was measured by psychological, physical, and sexual mistreatment; financial exploitation; and caregiver neglect. Cognitive function was evaluated by global cognition, episodic memory, working memory, processing speed, and Mini-Mental State Examination. Linear regression was used. At baseline, physical mistreatment and caregiver neglect were associated with lower global cognition and cognitive domains, while psychological mistreatment was associated with higher cognitive function. Older adults with incident psychological mistreatment, physical mistreatment, and caregiver neglect had a faster decrease in global cognition and cognitive domains over 2 years. This study is among the first to examine the association between different forms of EM and cognitive change. These findings provide a basis for engaging ethnic minorities with EM to maintain cognitive health.","Association between different forms of elder mistreatment and cognitive change Elder mistreatment (EM) is associated with worse physical health and psychological well-being, but little is known regarding its cognitive consequences.

The stem questions can be analyzed individually or combined into a scale, and researchers can account for severity as a robustness check. Analysts can also group the measures into specific types of elder mistreatment. A major strength of the EMM is its ability to identify perpetrators in victims’ core social networks. The NSHAP Round 3 EMM provides scholars an opportunity to study older Americans’ mistreatment experiences, particularly as they relate to their physical and mental health, their social networks and personal relationships, and their broader social contexts.","Elder mistreatment methods and measures in round 3 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project Elder mistreatment has negative consequences for older adults’ health and well-being.

The current study hypothesized that there is no effect of any of the following factors on any type of elder mistreatment: ethnicity, age group, education status, gender, living arrangement, concentration problems, medication for any disease, income level of caregiver, use of alcohol and tobacco products, and dependence on family or caregivers for daily activities. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 339 elders adults aged 60 or above residing in a rural part of eastern Nepal between August and November 2016.

Factors associated with elder mistreatment were analyzed using logistic regression. Our findings revealed that 61.7% of 60+-year-olds experienced some form of mistreatment (physical 2.4%, psychological 22.4%, caregiver neglect 57.5%, financial 12.1% and stranger-inflicted 8.3%). Elder mistreatment was associated with the following characteristics of elders: dependent on family for daily living activities, illiterate, experiencing concentration problems, residing in a living arrangement with their son(s)/daughter(s)-in-law, taking regular medications, belonging to the Dalit community according to the Hindu traditional caste system, and residing with a caregiver having a monthly family income of less than NRs. 20,000 (193USD).

Data were collected from a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,000 adults (18+). Multiple linear regression was used to test the relationship between “helping status” and personal distress attributed to an elder mistreatment, defined as someone aged 60 and older experiencing violence, psychological abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect by a caregiver. Nearly 30% of adults knew a relative, friend, or neighbor who experienced elder mistreatment. Of these, 67% reported personal distress resulting from the mistreatment at a level of 8 or more out of 10. Assuming a helping role was associated with significantly higher levels of personal distress. Greater distress was also associated with being a woman, increasing age, and lower household income. Knowing about an elder mistreatment situation is highly distressing for millions of adults in the United States, particularly for those assuming a helping role. We suggest intervention approaches and future research to better understand the role and needs of concerned persons.","When helping hurts: Nonabusing family, friends, and neighbors in the lives of elder mistreatment victims Elder mistreatment is an epidemic with significant consequences to victims.

A second objective was to compare socio-demographics and other characteristics between elderly groups with or without a history of mistreatment. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 43 sheltered homes and utilized a face-to face, self-reporting interview with residents to complete structured question regarding each participant’s previous 12 months. The questionnaires included seven sections, including one section for demographics, five sections for subtypes of mistreatments (physical, psychological, financial, sexual, and neglect), and one section about health status and functional capacity. Among the 446 elderly participants, 81% of all participants experienced at least one type of mistreatment. Psychological was the most common type of elder mistreatment (71%), followed by neglect (67%), financial mistreatment (54%), and physical mistreatment (13%). Sexual mistreatment was rarely reported by the participants (0.01%). The most common risk factors associated with elder mistreatment were female gender and chronic illnesses. Elder mistreatment is common among the elderly living in sheltered homes, particularly in woman and those with chronic illness. Further studies are needed to better understand the risk factors that lead to the high prevalence of mistreatment in these settings.","Prevalence and risk factors of elder mistreatment in sheltered homes Elder mistreatment is common in both community and institutional settings.

This article provides an overview of key issues related to the prevention and treatment of elder mistreatment, focusing on initiatives that can be addressed by the White House Conference on Aging. We review research on the extent of mistreatment and its consequences. We then propose 3 challenges in preventing and treating elder mistreatment that relate to improving research knowledge, creating a comprehensive service system, and developing effective policy. Under each challenge, examples are provided of promising initiatives that can be taken to eliminate mistreatment. To inform the recommendations, we employed recent data from the Elder Justice Roadmap Project, in which 750 stakeholders in the field of elder mistreatment were surveyed regarding research and policy priorities.","Elder mistreatment: priorities for consideration by the white house conference on aging Elder mistreatment is recognized internationally as a prevalent and growing problem, meriting the attention of policymakers, practitioners, and the general public.

The risk of neglect and its harmful consequences coincides with the need for care that arises with difficulties completing activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). In this paper, we describe how new questions included in Round 3 (2015–2016) of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP-R3) can help detect the risk of elder neglect. Based on the 2,340 respondents who indicated problems with at least one ADL or IADL, we categorized respondents as at a higher risk of neglect if they were either: (a) not getting wanted help (WANTHELP) or (b) getting help from an undependable caregiver (UNRELIABLE). We tested the external validity of these indicators by examining their association with NSHAP-R3 measures of physical and mental health, personal hygiene, home tidiness, social support, and elder mistreatment, using t tests and chi-square tests. Those labeled higher neglect risk based on the WANTHELP variable showed significantly worse self-rated physical health, personal hygiene, room tidiness, mental health, partner support, family support, and elder mistreatment. The same correlates were significantly associated with higher neglect risk based on the UNRELIABLE variable, except for self-rated physical health, personal hygiene, and room tidiness. Findings suggest that these new measures can be useful for identifying NSHAP respondents who are at risk of types of neglect that can be associated with having I/ADL limitations.","Detecting Risk of Neglect in NSHAP Round 3 Using New Follow-Up Questions to Activities of Daily Living Measures Elder neglect is a type of elder abuse wherein an older adult’s basic needs remain unmet through negligence.

"Yunus, Raudah Mohd",2024,social science,English,Consequences of elder abuse and neglect among older adults in rural Malaysia,"Elder Abuse and Neglect (EAN) is a growing public health concern. With the rapid increase of older population worldwide and especially in developing countries, EAN is likely to escalate. Abuse in late life has been shown to cause various adverse health impacts. However, compared to the other two domains of family violence – child abuse and intimate partner violence (IPV) – research findings pertaining to EAN health consequences are relatively scarce. This study is divided into two phases. Phase I is a systematic review that seeks to gather and critically appraise all the existing evidence on the health consequences of EAN. Phase II is a two-year prospective cohort study that aims at investigating the longitudinal relationships between EAN and three outcomes: mortality, sleep quality and chronic pain. A total of 1927 older adults in Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan were recruited through a multi-stage cluster sampling strategy and interviewed face-to-face at baseline. One thousand one hundred and eighty nine (1189) were followed-up two years later through phone calls. Mortality was tracked using data from the National Registration Department. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and chronic pain was ascertained by self-reports consisting of two validated questions. Findings from Phase I ranked premature mortality, depression and anxiety as the most credible health outcomes of EAN. In Phase II, survival analysis and Cox regression showed no statistically significant difference of mortality risks between EAN victims and those not abused (β: 0.26, p=0.25), but patterns of hazard and survival plots suggested greater hazard and lower survival for EAN victims. A short follow-up period was a possible reason for statistical non-significance. With regards to sleep quality, abuse victims had significant worsening of sleep over the period of two years compared to their non-abused counterparts (β: 0.49, p=<0.01). Among the EAN subtypes, neglect and psychological abuse were identified as stronger contributors to poor sleep: neglect (β: 1.13, p=0.03), psychological abuse (β: 0.64, p=<0.01). On the other hand, EAN did not contribute to higher risks of developing chronic pain (β: 1.14, p=0.45). In conclusion, abuse in late life adversely affects health. Preventive and intervention measures to address this problem need to be carried out at multiple levels: individual, community, healthcare, larger environment and system. Scientific evidence related to other health impacts of EAN is still scarce, thus highlighting the need for more research.","Consequences of elder abuse and neglect among older adults in rural Malaysia Elder Abuse and Neglect (EAN) is a growing public health concern.

"Atim, Letizia Maria;Kaggwa, Mark Mohan;Mamum, Mohammed A.;Kule, Moses;Ashaba, Scholastic;Maling, Samuel",2023,medical,English,Factors associated with elder abuse and neglect in rural Uganda: A cross-sectional study of community older adults attending an outpatient clinic,"Elderlies are vulnerable to abuse, and evidence suggests that one in three elderlies experience abuse. Abuse can impact the well-being of older persons, decreasing their quality of life, leading to mental health challenges, and increasing morbidity and mortality rates. Evidence on older person/elder abuse and neglect is vital to facilitate initiatives, but there are fewer studies on elder abuse and neglect in Africa, particularly in Uganda. Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of different types of abuse and neglect, and their associated factors among older persons (aged 60 years and above) attending an outpatient clinic. In this cross-sectional study, information on sociodemographic characteristics, functional impairment using the Barthel Index, and elder abuse severity using the Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test were collected. In addition, types of abuse were assessed using questions adapted from the US National Research Council on elder mistreatment monograph. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the factors associated with elder abuse severity and the different types of abuse, respectively. Overall, the prevalence of elder abuse was 89.0%. Neglect was the most common type of elder abuse (86%), followed by emotional abuse (49%), financial abuse (46.8%), physical mistreatment (25%), and sexual abuse (6.8%). About 30.4% of the abused elders experienced at least two forms of abuse. Factors associated with elder abuse severity were having a secondary level of education and physical impairment. Moderate to severe functional dependence was associated with almost all forms of abuse. Individuals who reported the presence of a perpetrator were likely to experience neglect, emotional, and physical mistreatment. However, those who reported their perpetrators to the police had a higher likelihood of experiencing emotional abuse but were less likely to experience financial abuse. Emotional abuse was also associated with age above 80 years and attaining education (primary and secondary). Physical impairment and chronic medical conditions reduced the likelihood of experiencing neglect and financial abuse, and physical abuse, respectively. Uganda has a high prevalence of elder abuse and neglect. There is a need to design interventions for older adults at risk to prevent elder abuse from escalating further, where the present findings can be worthy of help.","Factors associated with elder abuse and neglect in rural Uganda: A cross-sectional study of community older adults attending an outpatient clinic Elderlies are vulnerable to abuse, and evidence suggests that one in three elderlies experience abuse.

In most countries, the elderly are the most neglected segment of the population, and there is insufficient information about elderly abuse perpetration or victimization in low-income countries like Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess elderly abuse perpetration or victimization among the elderly in Mizan Aman town, southwest Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 268 elderly people from May to June, 2021, by using a systematic sampling technique. The elderly abuse and the ASSIST tools were used to assess the elderly abuse and khat, alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use disorders, respectively. Moreover, multimorbidity and physical disability were also assessed. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to the Statistical Package for Social Science Version 23. A logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of elderly abuse. The prevalence of elder abuse was 41.8%, and the prevalence of poly substance, alcohol, khat, and tobacco use disorder was 32.5%, 19.4%, 12%, and 4.5%, respectively. Besides, the comorbidity of physical disability and multiple chronic diseases was 8% and 24.6%, respectively. Moreover, physical disability (AOR = 5.652, CI = 1.459, 21.894), multimorbidity (AOR = 3.972, CI = 1.898, 8.314), substance use disorder (AOR = 3.877, CI = 1.814, 8.286), age above 80 years (AOR = 8.452, CI = 2.273, 31.425), and poor social support (AOR = 3.372, CI = 1.043, 10.903) were positively associated with elderly abuse. The magnitude of elder abuse and comorbid multimorbidity, physical disability, and substance use disorder was high, and having multiple chronic diseases, physical disability, substance use disorder, advanced age, and poor social support were risk factors for elderly abuse.","A Community-Based Exploratory Cross-Sectional Study of Elder Abuse Perpetration or Victimization Among Elders in Ethiopia, 2022 Elderly abuse and comorbid problematic substance use, disability, and physical and mental illness have been major problems in low-income countries.

"Brijoux, Thomas;Neise, Michael;Zank, Susanne",2021,social science,English,"Elder abuse in the oldest old: Prevalence, risk factors and consequences","Experiences of abuse in relationships with an expectation of trust are a common phenomenon among older people and is called elder abuse (EA). This can take various forms, such as physical, verbal, emotional, psychological, financial, sexual abuse or neglect. Due to their high vulnerability and difficulties in receiving support, people aged over 80 years old have been pointed out as a group that needs special focus in research. Prevalence, risk factors and consequences of EA for different aspects of quality of life are explored among the oldest old. Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted in a representative sample of the oldest old in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). 988 self-report interviews without third persons present of the NRW80+ study are used to assess EA with the help of the elder abuse and emotional consequences scale (EACS). The EACS describes EA in six dimensions that give a broad understanding of EA. Prevalence of experiences of EA within the last 12 months was 54.1%. In logistic regression, multimorbidity, lower functioning, age below 90 years, smaller social network size, and aggressive behaviorwere significant risk factors for EA. People experiencing EA showed less life satisfaction and autonomy and increased loneliness and depressive symptoms. EA is prevalent among the oldest old. Serious consequences of EA on life results can be shown with a broad operationalization of EA. Future research should focus on a deeper understanding of reasons for EA and reflect on the relationship between and the perspectives of perpetrators and victims.","Elder abuse in the oldest old: Prevalence, risk factors and consequences Experiences of abuse in relationships with an expectation of trust are a common phenomenon among older people and is called elder abuse (EA).

FIPV exposure also is associated with social difficulties such as low socioeconomic status, legal issues, poor access to employment and education, housing instability, and difficulty meeting other basic needs. As a biopsychosocial problem, one discipline alone cannot adequately address FIPV. While individuals who experience FIPV traditionally seek respite, care and safety through domestic violence shelters, social services or courts, they also often present to health care settings. Building on the medical-legal partnership model with critical input from a community advisory board of individuals with lived experiences of FIPV, we implemented a person-centered approach in the health care context to cohesively integrate legal, safety, social, psychological and physical health needs and concerns. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Healing through Health, Education, Advocacy and Law (HEAL) Collaborative for individuals who have experienced psychological abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect related to child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and/or elder abuse, and review our real-world challenges and successes. We describe our interprofessional team collaboration and our pragmatic biopsychosocial framework for bringing together: professional and stakeholder perspectives; psychological, medical, legal, and personal perspectives; and clinical, evidence-based, and educational perspectives. There is no doubt that creating a program with biopsychosocial components like HEAL requires professionals appreciating each other's contributions and the need to begin working from a common goal. Furthermore, such a program could not be successful without the contributions of individuals with the lived experience we seek to treat, coupled with the external health care clinicians' input. We describe lessons learned to date in an effort to ease the burden for those seeking to implement such a program. Lessons include HEAL's more recent clinical adaptions to serve patients both in-person and via telehealth in the wake of COVID-19.","A biopsychosocial and interprofessional approach to the treatment of family and intimate partner violence: It takes a village Family and intimate partner violence and abuse (FIPV) is a critical public health problem with repercussions for mental and physical health.

This study’s objectives were to categorize caregivers into groups based on family conflict, examine whether the relationship to the recipient influences group membership, and determine whether these groups are associated with engaging in abusive and neglectful behaviors. This national, cross-sectional study of 453 dementia family caregivers used latent class analysis to generate groups based on family conflict and abuse accusations. A multinomial logistic regression determined if relationship type (i.e., being a spouse, child, or grandchild to the care recipient or having a nontraditional relationship) predicted group membership. Groups were examined as predictors of abusive and neglectful behaviors using analysis of variance. A 4-class solution emerged as the best fit: 3 groups with varying probabilities of family conflict and 1 group with elevated probabilities of abuse and neglect accusations. Relationship typed predicted membership in these classes. Group membership predicted abusive and neglectful behaviors. Adult children were more likely to experience high amounts of family conflict, whereas nontraditional caregivers were less likely to experience abuse and neglect accusations. Membership in the accusations group was a unique risk factor for abusive and neglectful behaviors. These findings support the need for continued investigation of family conflict in dementia caregivers. They also call to examine how family relationship types, including nontraditional family structures, influence caregiving outcomes.","Patterns of Family Conflict and Accusations of Abuse in Dementia Family Caregivers: A Latent Class Analysis Family conflict is a stressor for dementia family caregivers, yet its impact may differ based on the relationship between caregivers and their recipients.

Older adults who were male, younger, Hispanic, more educated, with higher incomes performed better on the simulated financial tasks. Better performance was also related to higher cognitive function and numeracy, and more experience with technology.

Consequently, APS caseworkers report FE investigations to be among the most difficult while simultaneously reporting low confidence in productive outcomes for these investigations. This necessitates finding ways to support APS FE investigations. This paper describes the structure, process, and formative findings of a collaboration between forensic accounting examiners and APS workers to investigate complex cases of FE. Among the 77 FE cases completed, forensic examiners reviewed multiple years of financial records which included over 101,000 transactions, totaling over $213,000,000.00 in finances, and identified over $8,000,000 in questionable activity. Scores on the 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire were high indicating high program satisfaction by APS workers, subject matter experts, and forensic examiners. These findings support the feasibility and acceptability of forensic accounting and APS collaborations to investigate complex cases of FE.","A collaboration between adult protective services and forensic accounting examiners to investigate complex financial exploitation: Formative evaluation findings Financial exploitation (FE) is one of the most common reports to Adult Protective Services (APS) and the cases are often complex.

This paper describes the structure, process, and formative findings of a collaboration between forensic accounting examiners and APS workers to investigate complex cases of FE. Among the 77 FE cases completed, forensic examiners reviewed multiple years of financial records which included over 101,000 transactions, totaling over $213,000,000.00 in finances, and identified over $8,000,000 in questionable activity. Scores on the 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire were high indicating high program satisfaction by APS workers, subject matter experts, and forensic examiners. These findings support the feasibility and acceptability of forensic accounting and APS collaborations to investigate complex cases of FE.",collaboration adult protective services forensic accounting examiners investigate complex financial exploitation formative evaluation findings financial exploitation fe common reports adult protective services aps cases complex consequently aps caseworkers report fe investigations difficult simultaneously reporting low confidence productive outcomes investigations necessitates finding ways support aps fe investigations paper describes structure process formative findings collaboration forensic accounting examiners aps workers investigate complex cases fe 77 fe cases completed forensic examiners reviewed multiple years financial records included 101000 transactions totaling 21300 finances identified 800 questionable activity scores 8item client satisfaction questionnaire high indicating high program satisfaction aps workers subject matter experts forensic examiners findings support feasibility acceptability forensic accounting aps collaborations investigate complex cases fe,collaboration adult protective services forensic accounting examiners investigate complex financial exploitation formative evaluation findings financial exploitation fe common reports adult protective services aps cases complex consequently aps caseworkers report fe investigations difficult simultaneously reporting low confidence  outcomes investigations  finding ways support aps fe investigations paper describes structure process formative findings collaboration forensic accounting examiners aps workers investigate complex cases fe 77 fe cases completed forensic examiners reviewed multiple years financial records included  transactions   finances identified 800 questionable activity scores  client satisfaction questionnaire high indicating high program satisfaction aps workers subject matter experts forensic examiners findings support feasibility acceptability forensic accounting aps collaborations investigate complex cases fe, adult  services forensic accounting examiners investigate  financial exploitation  evaluation findings financial exploitation   reports adult  services aps cases   aps caseworkers report  investigations difficult  reporting low   outcomes investigations   ways support aps  investigations paper     findings  forensic accounting examiners aps workers investigate  cases    cases completed forensic examiners reviewed multiple years financial  included      identified 800   scores  client  questionnaire    program  aps workers   experts forensic examiners findings support   forensic accounting aps  investigate  cases

The current study employed a randomized-control design to test the impact of a victim-focused, forensic center MDT relative to usual care (UC) on older adult victim and criminal justice outcomes. Cases of abuse, neglect, and/or financial exploitation involving a perpetrator in a position of trust were randomly assigned to MDT or UC. Outcomes were assessed via interviews with older adult victims, system-based advocates' surveys, and administrative data. According to system-based advocates, MDT had a better prognosis, higher across-agency coordination, and more types of engaged services relative to UC. Administrative data indicated low rates of APS case openings and prosecution. Findings provide support for continued use of MDTs following older adult maltreatment and highlight difficulties engaging older adults given the complex social and material circumstances often related to maltreatment.","A randomized-control trial testing the impact of a multidisciplinary team response to older adult maltreatment Forensic center multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) have emerged to address older adult maltreatment; however, little research is available on this approach.

"Neri-Candelaria, Asuncion",2018,social science,English,The perceptions of video surveillance and its influence on caregiver stress in the home care setting,"Given the stress involved in caring for elders, the propensity for abuse among the older adult population continues to be a problem, as the number of caregivers providing care in the home is increasing to meet the demand of an increasing population of older adults. One solution is to implement video surveillance in the home. The purpose of this phenomenological, retrospective and prospective study was to describe the perceptions and experiences of caregivers that affect stress in the home care setting and to describe participants' perceptions about the impact of video surveillance in the home environment on caregiver stress and elder abuse. Using a lens of critical ecological framework and privacy theory, the research questions inquired about the specific experiences of stress and the perceptions of the use of home surveillance of caregivers in the home. A sample of 9 older adult home caregivers were recruited from the United Jewish Council of the East Side Home Attendant Service Corp. Findings revealed that increased family, community, and agency involvement and support may offset the feelings of isolation of the home care environment and ensure the caregiver is given opportunities to engage in strategies designed to help cope with the inherent stressors of the job. In addition, video camera surveillance in the home care setting may provide social support through observation of the situation in the home, supporting both social control on the behavior of the caregiver and direct evidence of quality of care for the caregiver. The findings of the study help to highlight effective intervention strategies based on the specific stressors and stress relievers identified, serving to reduce the potential for older adult abuse and neglect in the home care setting.","The perceptions of video surveillance and its influence on caregiver stress in the home care setting Given the stress involved in caring for elders, the propensity for abuse among the older adult population continues to be a problem, as the number of caregivers providing care in the home is increasing to meet the demand of an increasing population of older adults.

We used nationally representative data on the adverse experiences of Korean adults in 2017 (n=2,974). Results showed similarities and differences in the PM of aging parents and parents-in-law. Common risk factors included children’s sex, greater victimization experiences, and co-residence. Daughters and daughters-in-law were more likely than their male counterparts to psychologically mistreat parents and parents-in-law. While parents’ PM was more frequent when children had a temporary work status and when parents were younger, PM of parents-in-law occurred more often when children had a full-time job, poor self-rated health, and a negative perception of family relations. These findings provide insights into policy intervention against PM, suggesting the need for complex prevention strategies for PM of aging parents and parents-in-law.","Psychological mistreatment by married children in Korea: Using the contextual theory to explain mistreatment of aging parents and parents-in-law Guided by the contextual theory of elder mistreatment, this study examined the psychological mistreatment (PM) of aging parents and parents-in-law by their married children and compared the risk factors of PM.

This study aimed to investigate factors associated with health care providers speaking with older patients about being subjected to abuse, and what facilitating measures staff preferred to help them achieve this. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among hospital health care providers (n = 154) in Sweden. Half of the respondents had experience of speaking about elder abuse. A high sense of professional responsibility (OR 3.23) and being less concerned about inflicting damage to the therapeutic relationship (OR 3.97) were associated with having spoken with older patients about being subjected to abuse. Written guidelines about elder abuse and a patient information sheet were the most preferred facilitating measures. Our findings indicate that increasing care providers’ sense of responsibility and addressing concerns about damaging the therapeutic relationship might be important factors to target in future interventions to improve health care response to elder abuse.","Factors associated with health care providers speaking with older patients about being subjected to abuse Health care providers have difficulties responding to elder abuse.

"Liu, Yanping;Hu, Fawen",2021,social science,English,Elder abuse in life stories: a qualitative study on rural Chinese older people,"Holding beliefs such as elder respect seems to make Chinese older adults vulnerable to feel abused. This study investigated how Chinese older people in the countryside perceive abuse and make sense of their abusive experiences while telling their life stories. Following a narrative approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 older persons living in a rural village, Yunnan province, China, collected their life stories, and paid special attention to their telling of abuses. Thematic analysis of the data suggests that elder abuse for the participants is a betrayal of trust that is established within Chinese cultural values. Four themes were identified in explaining the participants’ experiences of abuse: disrespect, dependency and the down-valued self, disconnection and rejection, and social comparisons in the construction of abuse. We discuss implications for future research and practices in stopping elder abuse.","Elder abuse in life stories: a qualitative study on rural Chinese older people Holding beliefs such as elder respect seems to make Chinese older adults vulnerable to feel abused.

Needell,2018,medical,English,Improving Quality of Care in Hospitals for Victims of Elder Mistreatment: Development of the Vulnerable Elder Protection Team,"Hospitals have an opportunity to improve the quality of care provided to a particularly vulnerable population: victims of elder mistreatment. Despite this, no programs to prevent or stop elder abuse in the acute care hospital have been reported. An innovative, multidisciplinary emergency department (ED)–based intervention for elder abuse victims, the Vulnerable Elder Protection Team (VEPT), was developed at NewYork-Presbyterian / Weill Cornell Medical Center (New York City). The VEPT is a consultation service available 24 hours a day/7 days a week to improve identification, comprehensive assessment, and treatment for potential victims of elder abuse or neglect. All ED providers have been trained on how to recognize signs of elder mistreatment. Any provider can activate the VEPT via a single page/telephone call, which triggers the VEPT's often time-consuming, complex assessment of the potential mistreatment victim. First, the ED social worker on duty performs the initial bedside assessment and separately interviews the potential perpetrator and/or caregiver. He or she then contacts the on-call VEPT medical provider to discuss next steps and other team members' potential involvement. For patients admitted to the hospital, the VEPT connects with the inpatient social workers and medical team to ensure appropriate follow-up and care planning. The VEPT program was launched in April 2017 after comprehensive training. Its impact will be measured by tracking the short-term and long-term mistreatment-related outcomes, as well as medical, mental health, functional, psychosocial, and legal outcomes of the vulnerable ED patients for whom the team provides care.","Improving Quality of Care in Hospitals for Victims of Elder Mistreatment: Development of the Vulnerable Elder Protection Team Hospitals have an opportunity to improve the quality of care provided to a particularly vulnerable population: victims of elder mistreatment.

"Manthorpe, Jill;Samsi, Kritika",2015,health/care,English,Care professionals' understanding of the new criminal offences created by the Mental Capacity Act 2005,"Implemented in 2007, the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 codified decision-making for adults unable to make decisions for themselves in England and Wales. Among other changes, two new offences of wilful neglect and ill-treatment were created under Section 44. Our study explored how the MCA was being implemented in community-based dementia care, focusing on frontline practice. Using qualitative longitudinal methodology, we interviewed 279 practitioners, in the London and South-East area of England, two or three times over 3 years. We applied framework analysis to identify and delineate recurrent themes. Views of the new offences were positive overall, but understanding ranged from partial to non-existent among some participants. Clinicians may be increasingly called upon to provide advice on whether an alleged victim or perpetrator lacks decision-making capacity in cases of suspected elder abuse. They need to be aware of the new criminal offences to ensure that people with dementia, among others, are not abused and that abusers are brought to account.","Care professionals' understanding of the new criminal offences created by the Mental Capacity Act 2005 Implemented in 2007, the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 codified decision-making for adults unable to make decisions for themselves in England and Wales.

"Syme, Maggie L.;Cohn, Tracy J.",2020,social science,English,Elder sexual abuse and implicit agism: Examining the warm-incompetent bias among mock jurors,"Implicit ageist beliefs about the warmth and incompetence of older adults may influence jurors’ perceptions and judgments of an older adult’s competence in legal cases hinging on capacity and consent, including elder sexual abuse. However, little is known about the nuances of implicit agism in elder sexual abuse cases, and if it can be attenuated. The current study proposed to address these gaps via a randomized vignette design administered to a community sample of 391 US adults. Mock juror participants evaluated an elder sexual abuse case involving an older married couple, in which the victim had dementia. Results suggest that implicit agism was present among mock jurors, consistent with a warm-incompetence bias, and was predictive of mock jurors’ guilt ratings. Age- and dementia-relevant jury instructions and mock juror gender were not found to be predictive of guilt ratings. Implicit agism among jurors should be addressed to reduce the potential for implicit age bias to affect elder sexual abuse cases.","Elder sexual abuse and implicit agism: Examining the warm-incompetent bias among mock jurors Implicit ageist beliefs about the warmth and incompetence of older adults may influence jurors’ perceptions and judgments of an older adult’s competence in legal cases hinging on capacity and consent, including elder sexual abuse.

Using data from the Elder Abuse Decision Support System (EADSS), we developed short-form measures of four types of elder abuse: financial, emotional/psychological, physical, and neglect. The EADSS data set contains 948 elder abuse cases (age 60+) with yes/no abuse substantiation decisions for each abuse type following a 30-day investigation. Item sensitivity/specificity analyses were conducted on long-form items with the substantiation decision for each abuse type as the criterion. Validity was further tested using receiver–operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, correlation with long forms and internal consistency. The four resulting short-form measures, containing 36 of the 82 original items, have validity similar to the original long forms. These short forms can be used to standardize and increase efficiency of APS investigations, and may also offer researchers new options for brief elder abuse assessments.","Development of short-form measures to assess four types of elder mistreatment: Findings from an evidence-based study of APS elder abuse substantiation decisions Improving the standardization and efficiency of adult protective services (APS) investigations is a top priority in APS practice.

Pickering,2024,health/care,English,Mechanisms Underlying the Use of Abusive and Neglectful Behaviors in Dementia Caregiving: The Role of Caregiver Mental Health,"In dementia family caregiving, caregiver psychopathology has been frequently identified as a possible risk factor for the use of physically abusive, psychologically abusive, and neglectful behaviors toward care recipients. Yet, the mechanistic role of psychopathology in the use of these behaviors is not understood. The purpose of the current study is to determine the role of caregiver mental health in their daily risk of engaging in physically and psychologically aggressive and neglectful behaviors toward their care recipient with dementia. We used an intensive longitudinal design to survey family caregivers daily over 21 days. Using generalized linear mixed models, we evaluated the differential impact of caregivers' (N = 453) experience of major depression and generalized anxiety disorders measured at baseline versus 9,513 daily ratings of depressive and anxiety symptom severity, and interactions across levels, on the daily odds of engaging in physically abusive, psychologically abusive, and neglectful behaviors. Caregivers with clinically significant depression or anxiety at baseline had higher daily odds of engaging in each type of abusive and neglectful behavior. Worsened depressive symptoms (compared to individuals' average across all days) on a given day were associated with increased odds of engaging in psychologically and physically aggressive behaviors on the same day. Worsened anxiety symptoms on a given day were associated with increased odds of psychologically aggressive and neglectful behaviors. A key finding was lack of a significant interaction effect between depression and anxiety disorders and mental health symptomology on the daily odds of engaging in abusive and neglectful behaviors. This finding indicates that daily depressive and anxiety symptoms are generalizable intervention targets across the family caregiver population and do not only increase risk among family caregivers with depressive and anxiety disorders.","Mechanisms Underlying the Use of Abusive and Neglectful Behaviors in Dementia Caregiving: The Role of Caregiver Mental Health In dementia family caregiving, caregiver psychopathology has been frequently identified as a possible risk factor for the use of physically abusive, psychologically abusive, and neglectful behaviors toward care recipients.

Until recently, this serious social problem was hidden from public view and was regarded as an essentially private matter. However, there is growing evidence that elder abuse is an important problem of public health and in the society. The objective of this study is to determine the degree of abuse of elder and vulnerable people in the families and communities of Eastern Bolivia. With this end in mind, we conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study with a sample size of 210 60-year-old people coming from different health care areas. Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI) and Yaffe’s Evaluation Form of Social Work were used. An abuse rate of 39% of the older adults was identified. The most common type of abuse observed was psychological abuse (32.4% of cases), followed by neglect (21.9%). Children were identified as triggers of the abuse in 66.7% of cases of abuse. The prevalence of elder abuse was similar to the prevalence of other types of abuse that exist in Bolivia, such as the gender-based abuse. Also, this prevalence is comparable to other developing countries and European countries. The profile of abused older adult is as follows: woman, widow, 70 years old, incomplete primary education, without an occupation, and an average of 4.59 children. The information obtained shows that dysfunctional families have a higher percentage of elder abuse.","Elder abuse in a developing area in Bolivia In many parts of the world, elder abuse happens almost unnoticed.

"Arens, Olivia Blumenfeld;Fierz, Katharina;Zúñiga, Franziska",2017,social science,English,Elder abuse in nursing homes: Do special care units make a difference? A secondary data analysis of the Swiss Nursing Homes Human Resources Project,"In special care units (SCUs) for residents with advanced dementia, both personnel and organizations are adapted to the needs of residents. However, whether these adaptations have a preventive effect on elder abuse has not yet been explored.  To describe the prevalence of observed emotional abuse, neglect, and physical abuse in Swiss nursing homes, to compare SCUs with non-SCUs concerning the frequency of observed emotional abuse, neglect, and physical abuse, and to explore how resident-related characteristics, staff outcomes/characteristics, and organizational/environmental factors relate to observed elder abuse. This is a secondary data analysis of the Swiss Nursing Homes Human Resources Project (SHURP), a cross-sectional multicenter study. Data were collected from 2012 to 2013 and are based on observed rather than perpetrated elder abuse. We performed multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions taking into account the hierarchical structure of the data with personnel nested within units and facilities. Of 4,599 care workers in 400 units and 156 facilities, 50.8% observed emotional abuse, 23.7% neglect, and 1.4% physical abuse. There was no significant difference between SCUs and non-SCUs regarding observed emotional abuse and neglect. Higher scores for ‘workload' and sexual aggression towards care workers were associated with higher rates of emotional abuse and neglect. Verbal and physical resident aggression, however, were only associated with higher rates of emotional abuse. Negative associations were found between ‘teamwork and resident safety climate' and both forms of abuse. Improving teamwork and the safety climate and reducing work stressors might be promising points of intervention to reduce elder abuse. More specific research about elder abuse in SCUs and the interaction between work climate and elder abuse is required.","Elder abuse in nursing homes: Do special care units make a difference?

Data were generated on 1,472 APS cases over six months in two California counties using the Identification, Services and Outcomes (ISO) Matrix, a comprehensive decision support system for APS. The ISO Matrix uses Short-Forms developed from the Elder Abuse Decision Support System (EADSS). Mini-Forms were developed from the Short-Forms and tested in order to reduce measurement burden. Mini-Forms were developed on each measure using sensitivity and specificity of the items in predicting the criterion of substantiation (yes/no). Psychometric quality was addressed by estimating predictive validity and Cronbach’s alpha of Short-Forms. Predictive validity and reliability were also estimated on the Mini-Forms as was their correlation with the Short-Forms. On Short-Forms, good predictive validity was found for all measures except those that were very rare. Results for even shorter Mini-Forms were mixed, and some will require further research on their reliability and validity. Short-Forms had good psychometric properties and some Mini-Forms did as well. Ongoing adoption by several California counties and Montana demonstrates the viability and sustainability of using the ISO Matrix for research and practice.","Balancing practicality and validity of elder abuse identification measures: Using data from adult protective services investigations In testing a comprehensive decision support system for Adult Protective Services (APS), this study addressed two problems common in APS research and practice: the psychometric quality of the measures and measurement burden.

The aim of this paper is to describe the phenomenon of elder abuse and neglect in a separatist faith-based society (ultra-Orthodox Jewish society—UOJS). A qualitative-phenomenological study with 28 social workers who underwent in-depth semi-structured interviews based on an interview guide consisting of the following items: visibility of the elder abuse and neglect phenomenon in the ultra-Orthodox society, and dilemmas and sensitive issues that arise when working with this population. Three main themes emerged: (1) Between the commandment to honor one's parents and concealment patterns: Cultural barriers to exposing the abuse and neglect phenomenon; (2) “Life is demanding:” The unique expression of abusive and neglectful behavior in the UOJS; (3) Culturally related dilemmas when intervening with cases of elder abuse and neglect. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish cultural belief is a differentiating component in the context of elder abuse and neglect.

"Abdi, Alireza; Tarjoman, Asma; Borji, Milad",2019,medical,English,Prevalence of elder abuse in Iran: A Systematic review and meta-analysis,"In the past century, elder abuse has become an important health issue and a stressful event that negatively affects the physical and mental health of the elders. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse in Iran through systematic review and meta-analysis. All articles about elderly abuse in Iran since 2005–2017 were searched using the Google Scholar search engine, four Iranian databases (Magiran, IranMedex, SID) and six international English language databases(Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct-Embase) with keywords of Elder Abuse, Elder Mistreatment, Elder Neglect, Abuse and a combination of these keywords.

"Hsueh, Yu-Chun;Chen, Chun-Yuan;Hsiao, Yi-Chen;Lin, Cheng-Ching",2019,medical,English,"A longitudinal, cross-lagged panel analysis of loneliness and depression among community-based older adults","In the present study, we intended to examine the temporal association between loneliness and depression among community-based older adults. We analyzed data on 3,920 persons with a mean age of 67.6 years at baseline from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the temporal association between loneliness and depression over a period of 14 years. The results showed that the temporal association between loneliness and depression was bidirectional but stronger and more robust for depression as the initial symptom. Loneliness at Time 1 and 3, respectively, significantly predicted depression at Time 2 and 4. Depression at each time point had a significant effect on subsequent loneliness, even considering covariates. Future prevention programs for older adults with depression should also target at dealing with their loneliness, and vice versa. This study also highlights the need to assess and to manage the two symptoms simultaneously.","A longitudinal, cross-lagged panel analysis of loneliness and depression among community-based older adults In the present study, we intended to examine the temporal association between loneliness and depression among community-based older adults.

"Mysyuk, Yuliya;Westendorp, Rudi G. J.;Lindenberg, Jolanda",2016,social science,English,Older persons’ definitions and explanations of elder abuse in the Netherlands,"In this article we explore older persons’ definitions of and explanations for elder abuse in the Netherlands by means of interviews with older persons. A qualitative study was conducted based on semistructured interviews with 35 older persons who had no experience with abuse. Our findings show that older persons participating in our study define elder abuse foremost as physical violence that is performed intentionally. The study participants explain elder abuse as a result of the dependency and vulnerability of older persons, of changing norms and values, and of changes in the position of older persons in society, which result in disrespect toward older persons and a lack of social control and responsibility. The older persons’ explanations for the occurrence of abuse mainly focus on societal changes; older persons seem to regard elder abuse primarily as a societal problem. This understanding of, and explanation for, elder abuse may influence their detection and reporting behavior, as they may tend to acknowledge only severe cases of intentional physical violence that leave clear and therefore physically detectable evidence.","Older persons’ definitions and explanations of elder abuse in the Netherlands In this article we explore older persons’ definitions of and explanations for elder abuse in the Netherlands by means of interviews with older persons.

To do this, we used recently (2022) collected EAN survey fielded among home-dwelling residents of the Czech Republic aged 65 + . The results show that there is a clear relationship between EAN and these selected outcomes. Controlling for several sets of potential modifying or confounding factors further indicates that this relationship is substantial and direct, rather than weak and indirect. Among controls, only variables related to disadvantage (health, income, dependency, history of abuse) partly account for the link between EAN and its outcomes due to their relation to both heightened risk of EAN and lower well-being.","Outcomes of elder abuse and neglect in Central Europe: Exploring the link between EAN and well-being among non-institutionalized older adults Informed by existing gaps in the research of elder abuse and neglect (EAN) outcomes and very limited knowledge from Central-European cultural contexts, this paper analyzes the link between domestic-based EAN and three measures of well-being, namely subjective loneliness, sense of control over one’s life, and a broader outlook on life.

Houry,2015,health/care,English,"Violence in the United States: Status, Challenges, and Opportunities","Interpersonal violence, which includes child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and elder abuse, affects millions of US residents each year. However, surveillance systems, programs, and policies to address violence often lack broad, cross-sector collaboration, and there is limited awareness of effective strategies to prevent violence. To describe the burden of interpersonal violence in the United States, explore challenges to violence prevention efforts and to identify prevention opportunities. We reviewed data from health and law enforcement surveillance systems including the National Vital Statistics System, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports, the US Justice Department’s National Crime Victimization Survey, the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System—All Injury Program. Homicide rates have decreased from a peak of 10.7 per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 5.1 per 100 000 in 2013. Aggravated assault rates have decreased from a peak of 442 per 100 000 in 1992 to 242 per 100 000 in 2012. Nevertheless, annually, there are more than 16 000 homicides and 1.6 million nonfatal assault injuries requiring treatment in emergency departments. More than 12 million adults experience intimate partner violence annually and more than 10 million children younger than 18 years experience some form of maltreatment from a caregiver, ranging from neglect to sexual abuse, but only a small percentage of these violent incidents are reported to law enforcement, health care clinicians, or child protective agencies. Moreover, exposure to violence increases vulnerability to a broad range of mental and physical health problems over the life course; for example, meta-analyses indicate that exposure to physical abuse in childhood is associated with a 54% increased odds of depressive disorder, a 78% increased odds of sexually transmitted illness or risky sexual behavior, and a 32% increased odds of obesity. Rates of violence vary by age, geographic location, sex, and race/ethnicity, and significant disparities exist. Homicide is the leading cause of death for non-Hispanic blacks from age 1 through 44 years, whereas it is the fifth most common cause of death among non-Hispanic whites in this age range. Additionally, efforts to understand, prevent, and respond to interpersonal violence have often neglected the degree to which many forms of violence are interconnected at the individual level, across relationships and communities, and even intergenerationally. The most effective violence prevention strategies include parent and family-focused programs, early childhood education, school-based programs, therapeutic or counseling interventions, and public policy. For example, a systematic review of early childhood home visitation programs found a 38.9% reduction in episodes of child maltreatment in intervention participants compared with control participants. Progress has been made in reducing US rates of interpersonal violence even though a significant burden remains. Multiple strategies exist to improve violence prevention efforts, and health care providers are an important part of this solution.","Violence in the United States: Status, Challenges, and Opportunities Interpersonal violence, which includes child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and elder abuse, affects millions of US residents each year. However, surveillance systems, programs, and policies to address violence often lack broad, cross-sector collaboration, and there is limited awareness of effective strategies to prevent violence. To describe the burden of interpersonal violence in the United States, explore challenges to violence prevention efforts and to identify prevention opportunities. We reviewed data from health and law enforcement surveillance systems including the National Vital Statistics System, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports, the US Justice Department’s National Crime Victimization Survey, the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System—All Injury Program. Homicide rates have decreased from a peak of 10.7 per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 5.1 per 100 000 in 2013. Aggravated assault rates have decreased from a peak of 442 per 100 000 in 1992 to 242 per 100 000 in 2012. Nevertheless, annually, there are more than 16 000 homicides and 1.6 million nonfatal assault injuries requiring treatment in emergency departments.

In addition to the immediate effects of IPV, such as injury and death, there are other health consequences, many with long-term effects, including development of mental health conditions such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior; sexually transmitted infections; unintended pregnancy; and chronic pain and other disabilities. Long-term negative health effects from elder abuse include death, higher risk of nursing home placement, and adverse psychological consequences. To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2013 recommendation on screening for IPV, elder abuse, and abuse of vulnerable adults. The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for IPV in adolescents, women, and men; for elder abuse; and for abuse of vulnerable adults. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for IPV in women of reproductive age and providing or referring women who screen positive to ongoing support services has a moderate net benefit. There is adequate evidence that available screening instruments can identify IPV in women. The evidence does not support the effectiveness of brief interventions or the provision of information about referral options in the absence of ongoing supportive intervention components. The evidence demonstrating benefit of ongoing support services is predominantly found in studies of pregnant or postpartum women. The benefits and harms of screening for elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults are uncertain, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for IPV in women of reproductive age and provide or refer women who screen positive to ongoing support services. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for abuse and neglect in all older or vulnerable adults.","Screening for Intimate Partner Violence, Elder Abuse, and Abuse of Vulnerable Adults: US Preventive Services Task Force Final Recommendation Statement Intimate partner violence (IPV) and abuse of older or vulnerable adults are common in the United States but often remain undetected.

Dual review of titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. Data were not pooled, primarily because of heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and outcomes. Abuse or neglect, morbidity caused by abuse, test accuracy, and harms. Thirty studies were included (N = 14 959). Three RCTs (n = 3759) compared IPV screening with no screening; none found significant improvements in outcomes (eg, IPV or quality of life) over 3 to 18 months and 2 (n = 935) reported no harms of screening. Nine studies assessed tools to detect any past-year or current IPV in women; for past-year IPV (5 studies [n = 6331]), sensitivity of 5 tools ranged from 65% to 87% and specificity ranged from 80% to 95%. The accuracy of 5 tools (4 studies [n = 1795]) for detecting current abuse varied widely; sensitivity ranged from 46% to 94% and specificity ranged from 38% to 95%. Eleven RCTs (n = 6740) evaluated interventions for women with screen-detected IPV. Two enrolling pregnant women (n = 575) found significantly less IPV among women in the intervention group: 1 home visiting intervention (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.34 [95% CI, −0.59 to −0.08]) and 1 behavioral counseling intervention for multiple risks (IPV, smoking, depression, tobacco exposure) (SMD, −0.40 [95% CI, −0.68 to −0.12]). No studies evaluated screening or interventions for elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults. One study assessing a screening tool for elder abuse had poor accuracy (sensitivity, 46% and specificity, 73% for detecting physical or verbal abuse). Although available screening tools may reasonably identify women experiencing IPV, trials of IPV screening in adult women did not show a reduction in IPV or improvement in quality of life over 3 to 18 months.

B. Cooper; C. Crockett,2015,social science,English,Gender-based violence and HIV across the life course: adopting a sexual rights framework to include older women,"It is widely known that older women are at lesser risk for sexual violence than younger women, but current inattention to older women in the gender-based violence (GBV) field has minimized the experiences of older women survivors at great detriment to their health and rights. For example, health providers seldom ask older women about their sexual activity and relationships, a neglect that leads to older women being excluded from necessary HIV testing and care as well as support services for abuse. This oversight is increasingly worrisome given the rise in new HIV infections among adults age 50 and older in recent years, with the majority of transmissions stemming from individuals unaware of their HIV-positive status. Building on sexual rights scholarship, this paper argues for an approach to public health interventions for GBV and HIV that acknowledges older women – their sexuality, sexual agency, and activity – so that health providers and advocates acknowledge and serve older survivors.","Gender-based violence and HIV across the life course: adopting a sexual rights framework to include older women It is widely known that older women are at lesser risk for sexual violence than younger women, but current inattention to older women in the gender-based violence (GBV) field has minimized the experiences of older women survivors at great detriment to their health and rights.

Building on sexual rights scholarship, this paper argues for an approach to public health interventions for GBV and HIV that acknowledges older women – their sexuality, sexual agency, and activity – so that health providers and advocates acknowledge and serve older survivors.",genderbased violence hiv life course adopting sexual rights framework include older women widely known older women lesser risk sexual violence younger women current inattention older women genderbased violence gbv field minimized experiences older women survivors great detriment health rights example health providers seldom ask older women sexual activity relationships neglect leads older women excluded necessary hiv testing care support services abuse oversight increasingly worrisome given rise new hiv infections adults age 50 older recent years majority transmissions stemming individuals unaware hivpositive status building sexual rights scholarship paper argues approach public health interventions gbv hiv acknowledges older women  sexuality sexual agency activity  health providers advocates acknowledge serve older survivors,genderbased violence hiv life course  sexual rights framework include older women widely known older women lesser risk sexual violence younger women current  older women genderbased violence gbv field  experiences older women survivors great  health rights example health providers seldom ask older women sexual activity relationships neglect leads older women excluded necessary hiv testing care support services abuse oversight increasingly worrisome given rise new hiv infections adults age 50 older recent years majority  stemming individuals unaware  status building sexual rights scholarship paper argues approach public health interventions gbv hiv acknowledges older women  sexual agency activity health providers advocates acknowledge serve older survivors,genderbased violence hiv life   sexual rights framework  older women   older women  risk sexual violence younger women   older women genderbased violence    experiences older women survivors   health rights  health providers   older women sexual  relationships neglect  older women   hiv testing care support services abuse  increasingly  given rise new hiv infections adults age 50 older recent years    individuals     sexual rights scholarship paper    health interventions  hiv  older women sexuality sexual agency  health providers advocates   older survivors

Using data from the National Elder Mistreatment Study (NEMS), we compared contextual characteristics and elder mistreatment prevalence rates from a community-based sample of AIAN (n = 195) and Black (n = 437) and White (n = 5,013) respondents. There were differences in the prevalence of 16 abuse types and the 23 contextual variables. AIAN respondents had more similarities compared with Black respondents than White respondents, though differences existed. The cumulative prevalence of emotional, physical, and sexual mistreatment in the past year, neglect, and financial abuse by a family member for the AIAN group was 33%, almost double the 17.1% reported in the NEMS study. Over their lifetime, 29.7% of AIAN respondents reported experiencing two or more types of neglect, exploitation, or mistreatment. Almost one fourth of AIAN respondents reported emotional abuse since 60 years of age (the most commonly occurring abuse type)—nearly double that of White respondents. This is the first study to offer comparative prevalence of elder abuse for both AIAN older males and females that draws from a nationally representative sample. The study also provides descriptive analysis of important contextual information within the AIAN population, an underrepresented racial group in elder abuse research. Disaggregating nonmajority racial groups to examine contextual variables and the prevalence of elder mistreatment in the NEMS data set specific to AIAN respondents fills a knowledge gap. Known prevalence of various abuse typologies among AIAN elders can be useful in setting priorities for community planning and response, and in prioritization of funding for future research on causative mechanisms by abuse type, screening, and interventions at various levels. Findings may facilitate development of culturally specific evidence-based prevention and intervention practices aimed at needs specific to AIAN older adults.","Exploration and comparison of contextual characteristics and mistreatment prevalence among older American Indian and Alaska Native respondents: Secondary analysis of the National Elder Mistreatment Study Limited research on elder abuse among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIANs) suggests a higher prevalence of abuse.

We conducted three focus groups with 26 participants recruited from senior centers dedicated to LGBT older adults. A semistructured questionnaire was developed, and focus groups were audio recorded, professionally transcribed, and analyzed using grounded theory. Key themes that emerged included: definitions and etiologies of abuse, intersectionality of discrimination from multiple minority identities, reluctance to report, and suggestions for improving outreach. Participants defined elder abuse in multiple ways, including abuse from systems and by law enforcement and medical providers. Commonly reported etiologies included: social isolation due to discrimination, internalization of stigma, intersection of discrimination from multiple minority identities, and an abuser's desire for power and control. Participants were somewhat hesitant to report to police; however, most felt strongly that they would not report abuse to their medical provider. Most reported that they would feel compelled to report if they knew someone was being abused; however, they did not know who to report to. Strategies participants suggested to improve outreach included: increasing awareness about available resources and researchers engaging with the LGBT community directly.

The purpose of this article is to examine the attitudes and perceptions of health professionals in responding to elder mistreatment and to compare these attitudes and perceptions to those of APS workers who investigate abuse. Focus groups were conducted with APS workers (n = 9) and two types of health professionals: geriatric care managers (n = 4) and hospice staff (n = 13). Transcripts were coded inductively, and emergent themes were compared across groups using thematic analysis. Health professionals and APS workers acknowledged similar challenges resolving cases of EAN—particularly victim refusal of services or denial of abuse, limited APS authority, and large caseloads. APS workers identified unnecessary referrals and poor communication among providers as barriers to effectiveness. Health care workers noted they sometimes ignored mandatory reporting requirements, preferring to work directly with patients and families to remedy abuse. Results suggest that mandatory reporting may be a necessary but insufficient approach. Cross-agency collaboration between APS and health professionals may help enhance communications, clarify expectations, and potentially improve outcomes. Person-centered responses that link victims with community-based services should also be explored to improve victim cooperation and to increase confidence in the adult protection system.","Voices from the frontlines: Examining elder abuse from multiple professional perspectives Little is known about the experiences of health professionals in reporting suspected elder abuse and neglect (EAN) or the perceptions of Adult Protective Services (APS) in responding to reports.

P. R. Baker; D. P. Francis; N. N. Hairi; S. Othman; W. Y. Choo,2016,social science,English,Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly,"Maltreatment of older people (elder abuse) includes psychological, physical, sexual abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Evidence suggests that 10% of older adults experience some form of abuse, and only a fraction of cases are actually reported or referred to social services agencies. Elder abuse is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Numerous interventions have been implemented to address the issue of elder maltreatment. It is, however, unclear which interventions best serve to prevent or reduce elder abuse. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary intervention programmes used to reduce or prevent abuse of the elderly in their own home, in organisational or institutional and community settings. The secondary objective was to investigate whether intervention effects are modified by types of abuse, types of participants, setting of intervention, or the cognitive status of older people. We searched 19 databases (AgeLine, CINAHL, Psycinfo, MEDLINE, Embase, Proquest Central, Social Services Abstracts‎, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Web of Science, LILACS, EPPI, InfoBase, CENTRAL, HMIC, Opengrey and Zetoc) on 12 platforms, including multidisciplinary disciplines covering medical, health, social sciences, social services, legal, finance and education. We also browsed related organisational websites, contacted authors of relevant articles and checked reference lists. Searches of databases were conducted between 30 August 2015 and 16 March 2016 and were not restricted by language. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and quasi‐RCTs, before‐and‐after studies, and interrupted time series. Only studies with at least 12 weeks of follow‐up investigating the effect of interventions in preventing or reducing abuse of elderly people and those who interact with the elderly were included. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' risk of bias. Studies were categorised as: 1) education on elder abuse, 2) programmes to reduce factors influencing elder abuse, 3) specific policies for elder abuse, 4) legislation on elder abuse, 5) programmes to increase detection rate on elder abuse, 6) programmes targeted to victims of elder abuse, and 7) rehabilitation programmes for perpetrators of elder abuse. All studies were assessed for study methodology, intervention type, setting, targeted audience, intervention components and intervention intensity. The search and selection process produced seven eligible studies which included a total of 1924 elderly participants and 740 other people. Four of the above seven categories of interventions were evaluated by included studies that varied in study design. Eligible studies of rehabilitation programmes, specific policies for elder abuse and legislation on elder abuse were not found. All included studies contained a control group, with five of the seven studies describing the method of allocation as randomised. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and EPOC assessment criteria to assess risk of bias. The results suggest that risk of bias across the included body of research was high, with at least 40% of the included studies judged as being at high risk of bias. Only one study was judged as having no domains at high risk of bias, with two studies having two of 11 domains at high risk. One study was judged as being at high risk of bias across eight of 11 domains. All included studies were set in high‐income countries, as determined by the World Bank economic classification (USA four, Taiwan one, UK two). None of the studies provided specific information or analysis on equity considerations, including by socio‐economic disadvantage, although one study was described as being set in a housing project. One study performed some form of cost‐effectiveness analysis on the implementation of their intervention programmes, although there were few details on the components and analysis of the costing. We are uncertain whether these interventions reduce the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse due to variation in settings, measures and effects reported in the included studies, some of which were very small and at a high risk of bias (low‐ and very low‐quality evidence).Two studies measured the occurrence of elder abuse. A high risk of bias study found a difference in the post‐test scores (P value 0.048 and 0.18). In a low risk of bias study there was no difference found (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =0.48, 95% 0.18 to 1.27) (n = 214). For interventions measuring abuse recurrence, one small study (n = 16) reported no difference in post‐test means, whilst another found higher levels of abuse reported for the intervention arms (Cox regression, combined intervention hazard ratio (HR) = 1.78, alpha level = 0.01). It is uncertain whether targeted educational interventions improve the relevant knowledge of health professionals and caregivers (very low‐quality evidence), although they may improve detection of resident‐to‐resident abuse. The concept of measuring improvement in detection or reporting as opposed to measuring the occurrence or recurrence of abuse is complicated. An intervention of public education and support services aimed at victims may also improve rates of reporting, however it is unclear whether this was due to an increase in abuse recurrence or better reporting of abuse.The effectiveness of service planning interventions at improving the assessment and documentation of related domains is uncertain. Unintended outcomes were not reported in the studies.There is inadequate trustworthy evidence to assess the effects of elder abuse interventions on occurrence or recurrence of abuse, although there is some evidence to suggest it may change the combined measure of anxiety and depression of caregivers. There is a need for high‐quality trials, including from low‐ or middle‐income countries, with adequate statistical power and appropriate study characteristics to determine whether specific intervention programmes, and which components of these programmes, are effective in preventing or reducing abuse episodes among the elderly. It is uncertain whether the use of educational interventions improves knowledge and attitude of caregivers, and whether such programmes also reduce occurrence of abuse, thus future research is warranted. In addition, all future research should include a component of cost‐effectiveness analysis, implementation assessment and equity considerations of the specific interventions under review.","Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly Maltreatment of older people (elder abuse) includes psychological, physical, sexual abuse, neglect and financial exploitation.

All included studies contained a control group, with five of the seven studies describing the method of allocation as randomised. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and EPOC assessment criteria to assess risk of bias. The results suggest that risk of bias across the included body of research was high, with at least 40% of the included studies judged as being at high risk of bias. Only one study was judged as having no domains at high risk of bias, with two studies having two of 11 domains at high risk. One study was judged as being at high risk of bias across eight of 11 domains. All included studies were set in high‐income countries, as determined by the World Bank economic classification (USA four, Taiwan one, UK two). None of the studies provided specific information or analysis on equity considerations, including by socio‐economic disadvantage, although one study was described as being set in a housing project. One study performed some form of cost‐effectiveness analysis on the implementation of their intervention programmes, although there were few details on the components and analysis of the costing. We are uncertain whether these interventions reduce the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse due to variation in settings, measures and effects reported in the included studies, some of which were very small and at a high risk of bias (low‐ and very low‐quality evidence).Two studies measured the occurrence of elder abuse. A high risk of bias study found a difference in the post‐test scores (P value 0.048 and 0.18). In a low risk of bias study there was no difference found (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =0.48, 95% 0.18 to 1.27) (n = 214). For interventions measuring abuse recurrence, one small study (n = 16) reported no difference in post‐test means, whilst another found higher levels of abuse reported for the intervention arms (Cox regression, combined intervention hazard ratio (HR) = 1.78, alpha level = 0.01). It is uncertain whether targeted educational interventions improve the relevant knowledge of health professionals and caregivers (very low‐quality evidence), although they may improve detection of resident‐to‐resident abuse. The concept of measuring improvement in detection or reporting as opposed to measuring the occurrence or recurrence of abuse is complicated. An intervention of public education and support services aimed at victims may also improve rates of reporting, however it is unclear whether this was due to an increase in abuse recurrence or better reporting of abuse.The effectiveness of service planning interventions at improving the assessment and documentation of related domains is uncertain. Unintended outcomes were not reported in the studies.There is inadequate trustworthy evidence to assess the effects of elder abuse interventions on occurrence or recurrence of abuse, although there is some evidence to suggest it may change the combined measure of anxiety and depression of caregivers. There is a need for high‐quality trials, including from low‐ or middle‐income countries, with adequate statistical power and appropriate study characteristics to determine whether specific intervention programmes, and which components of these programmes, are effective in preventing or reducing abuse episodes among the elderly. It is uncertain whether the use of educational interventions improves knowledge and attitude of caregivers, and whether such programmes also reduce occurrence of abuse, thus future research is warranted. In addition, all future research should include a component of cost‐effectiveness analysis, implementation assessment and equity considerations of the specific interventions under review.",interventions preventing abuse elderly maltreatment older people elder abuse includes psychological physical sexual abuse neglect financial exploitation evidence suggests 10 older adults

"Berg, Karin;Kjellberg, Inger",2024,social science,English,Managing reports of trouble: Designated officials’ responses to reports of mistreatments initiated by service users and relatives,"Mandatory reporting of elder abuse aims to detect and prevent mistreatment and improve services. Service users and their relatives can raise concerns, but only staff can file mandatory reports. This article examines how the concerns of service users and relatives were managed by designated officials in reports of mistreatments in care for older adults in Sweden. We lean on sociological theories of “interpersonal trouble” and organizational “disputes domains.” The thematic analysis is based on 28 incident reports initiated by service users or their relatives. The analysis shows that the reports were managed in one of three ways: asymmetrically, by 1) dismissing or 2) supporting the complainant’s position, or symmetrically, by 3) treating complainants’ accounts as credible but minimizing their seriousness. There were differences between reports initiated by service users and relatives. Dismissing concerns about abuse, mainly those made by relatives, risks support for service users failing.","Managing reports of trouble: Designated officials’ responses to reports of mistreatments initiated by service users and relatives Mandatory reporting of elder abuse aims to detect and prevent mistreatment and improve services.

L. P. Zhang; Y. G. Du; H. Y. Dou; J. Liu,2022,health/care,English,The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect in rural areas: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Many epidemiological studies have reported that elder abuse and neglect were prevalent in rural areas. However, none of them has synthesized the literature in this field. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the overall prevalence of elder abuse and neglect in rural areas through a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to identify eligible articles, with no language restrictions. Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager software (version 5.3). Meta-analyses and sensitivity analysis were performed using a random-effects model. All results were reported as the pooled prevalence of elder and neglect with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of the included studies was evaluated by strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Potential publication bias was assessed by the funnel plot. 13 cross-sectional studies involving 10,313 participants were eligible. The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect ranged from 4.5 to 61.7% across the rural areas, and pooled prevalence estimate was 33% (95% CI 23–43). The prevalence of physical abuse was estimated at 7% (95% CI 5–9), financial abuse at 5% (95% CI 4–7), psychological/emotional abuse at 17% (95% CI 11–23), and neglect at 26% (95% CI 17–35). There was significant heterogeneity among the included studies. Stratified analyses revealed that sampling design was part of the heterogeneity source. WHO regions, gender, countries’ income classification, and study quality could not explain the potential reasons for heterogeneity. The pooled prevalence of elder abuse and neglect was relatively high in rural areas. Early and targeted screening and prevention are needed. There is an urgent need for high quality studies using agreed definition of elder abuse and neglect to protect the potential high risk populations.","The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect in rural areas: a systematic review and meta-analysis Many epidemiological studies have reported that elder abuse and neglect were prevalent in rural areas.

"Georg Bollig, Gerda Schmidt, Jan Henrik Rosland, Andreas Heller",2015,medical,English,Ethical challenges in nursing homes-staff's opinions and experiences with systematic ethics meetings with participation of residents’ relatives,"Many ethical problems exist in nursing homes. These include, for example, decision-making in end-of-life care, use of restraints and a lack of resources. The aim of the present study was to investigate nursing home staffs’ opinions and experiences with ethical challenges and to find out which types of ethical challenges and dilemmas occur and are being discussed in nursing homes. The study used a two-tiered approach, using a questionnaire on ethical challenges and systematic ethics work, given to all employees of a Norwegian nursing home including nonmedical personnel, and a registration of systematic ethics discussions from an Austrian model of good clinical practice. Ninety-one per cent of the nursing home staff described ethical problems as a burden. Ninety per cent experienced ethical problems in their daily work. The top three ethical challenges reported by the nursing home staff were as follows: lack of resources (79%), end-of-life issues (39%) and coercion (33%). To improve systematic ethics work, most employees suggested ethics education (86%) and time for ethics discussion (82%). Of 33 documented ethics meetings from Austria during a 1-year period, 29 were prospective resident ethics meetings where decisions for a resident had to be made. Agreement about a solution was reached in all 29 cases, and this consensus was put into practice in all cases. Residents did not participate in the meetings, while relatives participated in a majority of case discussions. In many cases, the main topic was end-of-life care and life-prolonging treatment. Lack of resources, end-of-life issues and coercion were ethical challenges most often reported by nursing home staff. The staff would appreciate systematic ethics work to aid decision-making. Resident ethics meetings can help to reach consensus in decision-making for nursing home patients. In the future, residents’ participation should be encouraged whenever possible.","Ethical challenges in nursing homes-staff's opinions and experiences with systematic ethics meetings with participation of residents’ relatives Many ethical problems exist in nursing homes.

B. Marzbani; E. Ayubi; M. Barati; P. Sahrai,2023,health/care,English,The relationship between social support and dimensions of elder maltreatment: a systematic review and Meta-analysis,"Many studies have investigated the relationship between social support and the prevention of elder abuse; however, their results are somehow inconsistent in terms of the association. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the published studies on the relationship between social support and the prevention of elder maltreatment. An electronic search was conducted until January 2023, using such databases as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The present research included cross-sectional, longitudinal, and case-control studies. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted by two researchers independently. The Newcastle-Ottawa checklist was utilized to evaluate the quality of studies. The random effects model was employed to perform a meta-analysis. In total, 32 studies were included in this systematic review, out of which 26 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. The results showed that 68.75% of the studies were of high quality, and there is a significant relationship between social support and elder maltreatment. Accordingly, the lack of social support increased overall maltreatment (odds ratio: 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.16–1.33; I2 = 92.3%, p = 0.000)). Moreover, lack of social support had an increasing effect on the level of psychological abuse (1.55, 1.18–2.04; 88.7%, p = 0.000), physical abuse (1.31, 0.42–4.11; 76.3%, p = 0.005), and neglect (2.02, 0.86–4.72; 87.9%, p = 0.000), which shows heterogeneities among the results of the included studies. On the contrary, the lack of social support showed a decreasing effect on financial abuse (0.92, 0.70–1.21; 62.1%, p = 0.022). This systematic review provides evidence that social support in the form of structural or functional support may plays an important role in improving the quality of life of the elderly.","The relationship between social support and dimensions of elder maltreatment: a systematic review and Meta-analysis Many studies have investigated the relationship between social support and the prevention of elder abuse; however, their results are somehow inconsistent in terms of the association.

U. N. Yadav; G. Paudel,2016,health/care,English,Prevalence and associated factors of elder mistreatment: a cross sectional study from urban Nepal,"mistreatment of elderly people is internationally recognised as a serious public health issue. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence and risk factors associated with mistreatment in urban Nepal. this was a descriptive cross-sectional study of 212 elderly people residing in Butwal sub-metropolitan city, an urban area in Nepal; the study was conducted between March and October 2015. Two-stage cluster design with simple random sampling was adopted for the study. Information was collected using an interviewer administered semi-structured questionnaire of older people. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with elder mistreatment. this study found a prevalence of 49.1% for mistreatment of the elderly population. Prevalence rates of caregiver neglect, financial, psychological or physical mistreatment and other types (including sexual assault) were 47.2%, 11.8%, 10.8%, 1.42% and 3.3%, respectively. Being a dalit (untouchable backward class in the traditional Hindu caste system), unemployed, widowed, divorced or separated, problems concentrating and smoking were independent factors associated with mistreatment. Smoking was found to be consistently associated with the three most common mistreatment types. mistreatment of older people is common in urban Nepal, with neglect, financial and psychological abuse most common. Along with standard risk factors, specific ethnic issues (membership of dalit community) are associated with increased risk.","Prevalence and associated factors of elder mistreatment: a cross sectional study from urban Nepal mistreatment of elderly people is internationally recognised as a serious public health issue.

"Liu, Pi-Ju;Caspi, Eilon;Cheng, Ching-Wei",2022,social science,English,Complaints matter: Seriousness of elder mistreatment citations in nursing homes nationwide,"Mistreatment of nursing home residents is prevalent and leads to harmful consequences. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’s (CMS) mission to protect residents’ right to be free from mistreatment is implemented partially through state survey agencies’ (SSAs) issuance of deficiency citations. The goal of this study was to compare SSA standard surveys and SSA complaint investigations with regard to the seriousness (scope and severity) of the mistreatment citations issued. A cumulative link mixed model was built to estimate the differences between standard surveys and complaint investigations in the seriousness of four core and two secondary mistreatment citations nationwide from 2014 to 2017. In all of the six mistreatment deficiency citations, complaint investigations were more likely to be determined as more serious compared with standard surveys. The findings reinforce the importance of strengthening nursing homes’ and CMS/SSA response to consumers’ concerns and grievances before they escalate into more harmful mistreatment.","Complaints matter: Seriousness of elder mistreatment citations in nursing homes nationwide Mistreatment of nursing home residents is prevalent and leads to harmful consequences.

"Shepherd, Benjamin F.;Brochu, Paula M.",2021,social science,English,How do stereotypes harm older adults? A theoretical explanation for the perpetration of elder abuse and its rise,"Mounting research shows that older adults who experience abuse are at elevated risk for a wide range of negative health and well-being outcomes. Yet, even as the older adult population grows and rates of elder abuse rise across the globe, the issue continues to be overlooked and perpetuated by individuals and institutions across various countries, cultures, and settings. Recognizing, addressing, and preventing the mistreatment of older adults is a challenge because elder abuse is not well-understood or extensively studied, and its root causes are perceived to vary from case to case. In order to fill this gap, we examine elder abuse and its associations with ageism through the lens of two empirically supported, cross-cultural models (i.e., the stereotype content model and BIAS map). These models explain how the acceptance and endorsement of societal stereotypes about older adults on dimensions of warmth and competence lead to emotion-driven, discriminatory behaviors ranging from neglect and abandonment to emotional, financial, and physical harm. This article also serves as a call to action, encouraging researchers, health professionals, policy makers, and community members to gain awareness of their own ageist beliefs and how they influence the way they perceive and interact with older adults.","How do stereotypes harm older adults?

This project, “Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner/Forensic Nurse Hospital-based Staffing Solution: A Business Plan Development and Evaluation,” provides an example for assessment, construction, implementation, and evaluation of a business plan for a sustainable sexual assault nurse examiner/forensic nurse staffing solution. By using preexisting float pool positions and converting them to sexual assault nurse examiner emergency nurses, coverage for sexual assault nurse examiner examinations in a 16-hospital health system was established, which decreased sexual assault nurse examiner turnover related to burnout while increasing the sustainability of sexual assault nurse examiner nurses who provided quality care to patients who had experienced a sexual assault, domestic or intimate partner violence, elder or child abuse or neglect, assault, strangulation, or human trafficking. Implementation of the business plan resulted in a 179% increase in completed sexual assault nurse examiner examinations and a 242% increase in all types of completed forensic examinations from 2015 to 2019 as 7 new community hospitals were added to the health system. A sum of more than $20 000 allocated for training new sexual assault nurse examiners/forensic nurses was saved per year by using a sexual assault nurse examiner emergency nurse. By creating a supportive structure that fosters and sustains sexual assault nurse examiners/forensic nurses, both medical and mental health concerns can be addressed through trauma-informed care techniques that will affect lifelong health and healing as well as engagement in the criminal justice process for patients who have experienced sexual assault, abuse, neglect, and violence.","Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner/Forensic Nurse Hospital-based Staffing Solution: A Business Plan Development and Evaluation Nationally and internationally, providing competent and sustainable sexual assault nurse examiner/forensic nurse coverage has been a shared challenge.

"Nordström, Karin;Wangmo, Tenzin",2018,health/care,English,Caring for elder patients: Mutual vulnerabilities in professional ethics,"Neglect and abuse of elders in care institutions is a recurring issue in the media. Elders in care institutions are vulnerable due to their physical, cognitive, and verbal limitations. Such vulnerabilities may make them more susceptible to mistreatment by caregivers on whom they are heavily dependent. The goal was to understand caregivers’ concerns about ensuring correct and proper treatment, as well as their experiences with neglect and abuse of older patients. This article examines resources and challenges of professional ethics within the care setting. A study was conducted to explore the quality of care provided to older patients in nursing homes, geriatrics institutions, and ambulant care in the northwest region of Switzerland. A total of 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted with nursing staff of varying experience levels. Ethical approval was granted by the competent regional ethics commission, Ethikkomission Nordwest-und Zentralschweiz EKNZ [Ethics Commission Northwest and Central Switzerland] (2014-015). Three themes emerged from our data analysis: professional identity, professional context, and professional relationships. Our findings indicate mutual vulnerabilities within these three themes, characterizing the interactions between nursing staff and older patients. Study participants believe that incidences of error, neglect, and abuse are consequences of their own vulnerability since they are not able to meet the demands of an overstraining work situation. Different aspects of this mutual vulnerability are described and critically discussed as challenges for professional ethics. Early education, continuous training as well as better management and response from the institution are necessary to maintain professionalism while handling mutual vulnerabilities.","Caring for elder patients: Mutual vulnerabilities in professional ethics Neglect and abuse of elders in care institutions is a recurring issue in the media.

"Asiamah, Nestor;Kouveliotis, Kyriakos;Eduafo, Richard;Borkey, Richard",2021,social science,English,Psychometric properties of a new scale measuring neglect and abuse of older adults in the community: Implications for social activity,"Neglect and abuse of older adults are still prevalent in communities of developing countries, a situation that could discourage active and healthy behaviors in community-dwelling older adults. This study used the cross-sectional and correlational approaches to construct a scale measuring neglect and abuse in older adults living in the community. The study population was all (3,211) older adults who were resident in Accra and were part of the database of the Social Security and National Insurance Trust. Participants were 515 individuals who met some inclusion criteria. Three steps were followed to determine an initial set of 11 items, and principal component analysis with varimax rotation and confirmatory factor analysis were used to select relevant items and assess the psychometric properties of the final scale. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation yielded a two-factor solution on all 11 items. The first factor extracted was “discrimination and exploitation,” which accounted for a variance of 53.9% out of total variance of 70.8%. The scale had a good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .90, factor loading ≥0.50). Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor solution and produced satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity. It is concluded that 11 items that make up 2 factors are potential indicators of neglect and abuse of older adults at the community level. Finally, neglect and abuse of older people in the community can contribute to an increase or decrease in social activity.","Psychometric properties of a new scale measuring neglect and abuse of older adults in the community: Implications for social activity Neglect and abuse of older adults are still prevalent in communities of developing countries, a situation that could discourage active and healthy behaviors in community-dwelling older adults.

K. Clarysse; C. Kivlahan; I. Beyer; J. Gutermuth,2018,medical,English,Signs of physical abuse and neglect in the mature patient,"Neglect and physical abuse of elderly are worrisome health problems, which are expected to grow even further, considering the aging of the population. By 2060, the number of people aged above 65 years is expected to double, whereas birth rates are low. This trend will cause a significant imbalance between different age groups and put more senior adults at risk for abuse. Risk factors, associated with abuse and neglect, are well established and can be categorized in sociodemographic-, victim-, or perpetrator-related risk factors. The effects of these risk factors depend mainly on the setting, which can be community-dwelling or institutionalized older adults. In community-based settings, 90% of perpetrators are family members. In each setting, suspicious physical injuries should be recognized and addressed promptly. This can be very challenging in elderly, among others, due to the age-related skin changes, which can mimic abuse; however, there are some cutaneous clues that should always raise suspicion of abuse, such as patterned shape or distribution, different healing stages of wounds, parallel injuries, signs of blunt trauma, and irregular patches of alopecia. General awareness is needed, and the advice of dermatologists, who are best trained to differentiate between those lesions, should be systematically sought, to reduce false-positive and false-negative interpretations.","Signs of physical abuse and neglect in the mature patient Neglect and physical abuse of elderly are worrisome health problems, which are expected to grow even further, considering the aging of the population.

Grodzicki,2020,medical,English,Exploring Elder Neglect: New Theoretical Perspectives and Diagnostic Challenges,"Neglect of older adults is a complex and important social problem which is difficult to detect. The aim of this review is to explore and categorize different characteristics of elder neglect, to facilitate a uniform conceptualization and provide recommendations for identification of the phenomenon. Articles published between January 1990 and February 2019, both from developed and developing countries, were taken into consideration. The literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL using keywords related to elder abuse and neglect. Articles regarding the concept of elder neglect, identifying or measuring this phenomenon were reviewed. The identified indicators were presented according to the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. From 7,207 articles found in the initial search, 63 relevant studies were selected for the final analysis. Indicators most frequently used by researchers (functionality, physical appearance and health, social and psychological background, mental health, and environment) correspond to different aspects of needs. Caregiver’s responsibility, satisfaction of needs, and risk of harm are the core elements to consider in identification of neglect. The identified elements and categories of indicators provide the framework for developing standard definitions and measures of elder neglect. The proposed diagram demonstrates gaps in identification and can be useful in detecting potential neglect in various categories of needs. Further research on perceptions and prevalence of elder neglect in different countries would be helpful for cross-country analysis as well as for adaptation of the instruments to cultural specifics.","Exploring Elder Neglect: New Theoretical Perspectives and Diagnostic Challenges Neglect of older adults is a complex and important social problem which is difficult to detect.

Normal changes of aging and disease-related symptoms may overlap with markers of neglect and lead to under-detection. This review aims to delineate medical, psychiatric, and pathophysiological indicators in the victim—identified in forensic case reports—to point out areas of overlap and raise awareness in Health Care Professionals. Medical and forensic databases were searched with the search terms: neglect, elder, elderly, forensic, homicide for detailed case reports on elder neglect. Cases were reviewed as to victim age, sex, medical/psychiatric diagnosis, perpetrator, victim-to-perpetrator relationship, cause of death (if fatal), location of incident, autopsy findings (if fatal), and ancillary studies. A total of 168 publications were retrieved, of these 11 publications, containing a total of 25 cases, yielded sufficient detail on each case to be included in the qualitative analysis. Neglect is associated with poor physical, psychological, and mental health. Neglect can be a direct cause of death or contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating existing conditions. Red flags of neglect included malnutrition, dehydration, poor hygiene, untreated decubitus ulcers, hypothermia, contractures, and an uncooperative caregiver. However, incontrovertible evidence of neglect is not always easy to obtain due to age and disease-related changes. The findings document the extent and seriousness of elder neglect and highlight the importance of detailed documentation as well as collaboration between clinicians, allied health professionals, law enforcement and medical forensic services to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of further incidents.","Neglect of older people: Touching on forensic and pathophysiological aspects Neglect of older people is common and may result in fatal and nonfatal outcomes.

"Jackson, Shelly L.;Hafemeister, Thomas L.",2016,law,English,Theory-based models enhancing the understanding of four types of elder maltreatment,"Notwithstanding that elder abuse has existed since antiquity, it was only during the 1990s that society began to recognize that elder abuse is a pervasive and pernicious problem needing a systematic response. Despite this emerging attention to elder abuse and society’s dedicated efforts to address it, little attention has been given to articulating a theory-based foundation to explain the occurrence of elder maltreatment, which in turn may explain why society’s efforts have had limited success. Using the results of our research as the foundation, we present here distinct models that encapsulate four types of elder maltreatment, including one model that focuses on what transpires when two relatively distinct forms of abuse co-occur. We assert that elder maltreatment should be divided into distinct subtypes reflecting their different etiologies, risk factors, interpersonal dynamics, correlates, and consequences, and which in turn necessitate distinct societal responses. Without recognizing that this abuse occurs in the context of a relationship, understanding of elder abuse and the building of relevant models will be significantly limited. Although the application of these models has not yet been empirically tested, their articulation should enhance the understanding of elder maltreatment and promote new lines of related research and societal responses.","Theory-based models enhancing the understanding of four types of elder maltreatment Notwithstanding that elder abuse has existed since antiquity, it was only during the 1990s that society began to recognize that elder abuse is a pervasive and pernicious problem needing a systematic response.

Over a six-month period in 2011, RNs meeting this criterion (n = 12) were interviewed individually. We identified two central categories: “Culture of Neglect” and “Vigil by the Bedside”. The core category “Normalization of Neglect” was identified as the theory, grounded in the data the participants provided which described a culture of neglect that had normalized poor nursing care. These findings highlight the issue of neglect and abuse, and further investigation is warranted.","Normalization of Neglect: A Grounded Theory of RNs’ Experiences as Family Caregivers of Hospitalized Seniors Often older people, while maintaining a level of independence, rely on family members to provide care and assistance.

Forgiveness is found to have a salutary effect, especially for older adults. To understand the place and role of forgiveness in the reflective process during aging, we performed a secondary analysis of in-depth, semi-structured interviews (N = 78) with older women survivors of abuse. Inductive thematic analysis was based on concepts developed deductively from the literature review. The findings include three main themes: (1) The dimensions of forgiving: The victim as subject; (2) Being forgiven: Between lost forgiveness and hope; and (3) Self-forgiveness and the aging self. Despite the known salutary effect of forgiveness, we must consider that this is not a universally desirable process. We included the dimension of forgiveness in the study of abuse throughout the older person’s life course and identified further complexities in addition to the “forgiveness”/“unforgiveness.”","Is lifetime abuse forgivable in old age?

Forgiveness is found to have a salutary effect, especially for older adults. To understand the place and role of forgiveness in the reflective process during aging, we performed a secondary analysis of in-depth, semi-structured interviews (N = 78) with older women survivors of abuse. Inductive thematic analysis was based on concepts developed deductively from the literature review. The findings include three main themes: (1) The dimensions of forgiving: The victim as subject; (2) Being forgiven: Between lost forgiveness and hope; and (3) Self-forgiveness and the aging self. Despite the known salutary effect of forgiveness, we must consider that this is not a universally desirable process.

"Hall, Yvette;Greco, Philippa;Hau, Kenny;Barak, Yoram",2020,medical,English,Older adults abuse: Analysis of a New Zealand national dataset,"Older adult abuse (OAA), defined as abuse, neglect, or mistreatment of persons aged 65 years or older, is a globally pervasive concern, with severe consequences for its victims. While internationally reported rates of OAA are in the range of 5–20% per annum, New Zealand lacks the necessary data to quantify the issue. However, with a growing aging population, an increase in the prevalence of OAA is predicted. We investigated the extent of OAA in New Zealand, utilizing the mandatory interRAI-HC (International Resident Assessment Instrument-home care assessment) dataset, which included 18,884 interviewees from the Southern District Health Board between 2013 and 2019. Findings confirmed our hypothesis that the interRAI assessment is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific capturing only 3% from a population of increased frailty and thus at higher risk of abuse. We characterized OAA victims as relatively younger males, depressed, and with impaired decision-making capacity. If the interRAIs were to serve as a preliminary screening tool for OAA in New Zealand, it would be germane to implement changes to improve its detection rate. Further studies are urgently called for to test changes in the interRAI that will aid in identifying often missed cases of OAA better and thus offer protection to this vulnerable population.","Older adults abuse: Analysis of a New Zealand national dataset Older adult abuse (OAA), defined as abuse, neglect, or mistreatment of persons aged 65 years or older, is a globally pervasive concern, with severe consequences for its victims.

This study explored ways in which opioid misuse underlies substantiated Adult Protective Services cases of elder abuse in rural Central Appalachia, a region that has been particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis. Using an intersectionality theoretical lens, we analyzed 25 opioid-related elder abuse cases from de-identified data records for substantiated abuse cases of persons aged 60 and older in 13 counties comprising Kentucky’s Eastern Mountain Service Region. Descriptive data and case notes were extracted from the records. We conducted a content analysis of the case notes, using open and focused coding strategies, to identify common themes. Twenty-one of the older victims of opioid-related abuse were women. Men and women were equally likely to be perpetrators. Two major themes emerged from the analysis: Patterns of Substantiation and Facets of Dependency. Cases frequently involved community dwelling older women as victims of abuse and nonspousal family members as perpetrators. In all cases, exploitation was the primary form of abuse substantiated. Findings suggest that opioid-related elder abuse cases are complex, with family loyalties and interdependences influencing how the cases played out. Practitioners are encouraged to take into consideration cultural norms and close relationships with extended family in the development of education and treatment program for addressing abuse within the context of opioid addiction.","Elder abuse and the opioid epidemic: Evidence from APS cases in Central Appalachia Older adults are negatively affected by the national opioid crisis, including being victims of abuse by family members and trusted others who struggle with opioid addiction.

We investigate the risk of repeat victimization and victimization by multiple scam types over the life course. Victims in their 70s and 80s are 9% more likely to experience another victimization incident than those in their 50s. Those age 18 to 29 are 24% less likely to experience another victimization incident. Relative to adults in their 50s, the odds of victimization by multiple scams are greater for those in their 60s and 70s, but lower for those 80 + . This study demonstrates the research potential in using scammers’ data to understand patterns of victimization. Fraud prevention efforts should target older individuals who are at higher risk of repeat victimization and suffer greater losses as a result.","Fraud victimization across the lifespan: Evidence on repeat victimization using perpetrator data Older adults are thought to be more susceptible to scams, yet understanding the relationship between chronological age and victimization is limited by underreporting.

Early and accurate detection of the elderly abuse phenomenon can help identify health-promoting solutions for the elderly, their family, and society. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate the psychometric properties of a questionnaire on elderly abuse by family caregivers among older adults on hemodialysis. Qualitative and quantitative research methodologies were used to develop the questionnaire. The item pool was compiled from literature reviews and the Delphi method. The literature reviews comprised 22 studies. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were verified using face, content, and construct validity, and the reliability was tested using Cronbach’s alpha reliability. A 57-item questionnaire was developed after the psychometric evaluation. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin index and Bartlett’s test of sphericity showed reliable results. Seven components from the exploratory content analysis including psychological misbehavior, authority deprivation, physical misbehavior, financial misbehavior, being abandoned, caring neglect, and emotional misbehavior explained 74.769% of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.98 and the interclass correlation coefficient was r=0.91 responding to the items twice (p<0.001), which shows a high level of tool stability. This study developed a questionnaire to assess elderly abuse by family caregivers among older adults on hemodialysis. It is recommended as a mini scale that can be used both in statistical and practical studies, and that is valid and reliable. Nurses or other health care providers can use it in health centers, dialysis centers, or at the house of the patient.","The design and evaluation of psychometric properties for a questionnaire on elderly abuse by family caregivers among older adults on hemodialysis Older adults with chronic disease are more vulnerable to abuse.

F. Mehdi; S. Dahlke; K. F.

World-wide 1 in 6 older persons experiences abuse. Due to population aging, attention must be paid to the abuse and victimization of older immigrant persons, and the concept of elder abuse. The purpose of this integrative review was to understand elder abuse from the perspective of older immigrants, who came to Canada in their 60s or older as dependents of families or sponsors. Whittemore and Knafl’s (2005) method of review resulted in six articles that met the inclusion criteria. Results revealed three themes: conceptualization of abuse, post-immigration stressors and cultural factors, and barriers to access support and protection. The perpetrators were often close family members including intimate partners, spouses, children, children-in-laws and grandchildren. Contextual factors that influenced abuse included: power imbalance, change in social status from head of the families to legal and financial dependents due to immigration, culture, ethnicity, gender role expectations and language barrier. More research is needed to understand the diverse older immigrants experiences of elder abuse.","Developing a Comprehensive Understanding of Older Person Abuse in Canadian Immigrant Communities: An Integrative Review Older immigrants represent 28% of the Canadian population who are over the age of 60.

Z. Naderi; S. Gholamzadeh; A. Ebadi; L. Zarshenas,2022,health/care,English,Development and psychometric properties of the hospitalized elder abuse questionnaire (HEAQ): a mixed methods study,"Older patients are more vulnerable and prone to abuse and neglect in hospitals and acute care settings. The present study aimed to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a questionnaire for screening abuse in hospitalized older adults. This study was conducted from October 2017 to September 2019 using the exploratory sequential mixed-methods research design. The participants were selected among those admitted to various wards of six teaching hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. In the qualitative phase of the study, using the inductive content analysis method, the concept of abuse in hospitalized older adults was extracted through individual in-depth semi-structured interviews with 16 older patients and 11 family caregivers. Based on qualitative findings and a review of existing literature, an initial version of the questionnaire was developed. In the quantitative phase of the study, the psychometric properties (face, content, construct, and convergent validity; internal consistency and stability) of the questionnaire were examined. Based on qualitative findings and literature review, a pool of 154 candidate items was defined. These items were reduced to 37 after initial refinement, qualitative and quantitative face and content validity, and item analysis. The outcome of principal component analysis further reduced the number of items to 27, which were grouped into 5 components, namely “Shortcomings in management and care facility”, “Neglect of professional commitments”, “Physical and psychological abuse”, “Protracted treatment process”, and “Invasion of privacy”. The explained variance of these 5 components was 50.09% of the overall variability of the questionnaire. The convergent validity of the questionnaire was acceptable (P < 0.00, r = − 0.44). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient for the entire questionnaire were 0.89 and 0.92, respectively; indicating high reliability and stability of the questionnaire. The hospitalized elder abuse questionnaire (HEAQ) has acceptable psychometric properties. It is recommended to use HEAQ to screen for suspected cases of abuse of hospitalized older adults.","Development and psychometric properties of the hospitalized elder abuse questionnaire (HEAQ): a mixed methods study Older patients are more vulnerable and prone to abuse and neglect in hospitals and acute care settings.

E. Yan; L. To; D. Wan; X. Xie; F. Wong; D. Shum,2022,social science,English,Strategies to build more effective interventions for elder abuse: a focus group study of nursing and social work professionals in Hong Kong,"One in six older adults living in communities experience abuse and neglect. Elder abuse has serious consequences for individuals, families, and society, including mortality, physical and psychological morbidities, and increased care requirements. Timely and effective interventions for elder abuse should therefore be a priority. This study used a qualitative focus group approach to address the following questions: What are the essential elements of elder abuse interventions? What can be done to improve current interventions? The 32 participants in this focus group study included social workers, medical social workers, and nurses from seven organizations who shared their knowledge and insights. All sessions were conducted online, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Three researchers with backgrounds in social work and psychology independently coded the transcripts and agreed on the themes emerging from the focus groups. Based on the experiences of frontline helping professionals in Hong Kong, we highlighted the key factors for effective elder abuse intervention: 1) identification and assessment; 2) essential skills and attitudes; 3) elements of effective interventions; 4) collaborative efforts across disciplines and agencies; and 5) raising awareness among professionals and the public. Training can equip frontline professionals with the necessary skills to identify elder abuse cases and to assess the risk of abuse. Effective interventions should not only address clients’ safety and need for tangible support but also respect their autonomy and privacy. A client-centered, strength-based approach that involves supportive peers and addresses the complex family relationships involved can be useful. Interventions should also involve cross-discipline and cross-agency collaboration.","Strategies to build more effective interventions for elder abuse: a focus group study of nursing and social work professionals in Hong Kong One in six older adults living in communities experience abuse and neglect.

Emergency radiologists have the potential to play an equally important role in the detection of elder physical abuse; however, they currently play little to no part in this effort. We examine the reasons behind this limited role, and potential strategies to expand it, by interviewing attending faculty from Emergency Radiology, Geriatrics, Emergency Medicine, Pediatric Radiology, and Pediatrics. Our interviews revealed that radiologists’ contribution to elder abuse detection is currently limited by gaps in training, gaps in knowledge about imaging correlates, and gaps in inter-team clinical communication. Specifically, radiographic interpretation of elder trauma is severely restricted by lack of communication between frontline providers and radiologists about patients’ injury mechanism and functional status. Improving this communication and re-conceptualizing ED workflow is critical to expanding and optimizing radiologists’ role in elder abuse detection.","A new role for imaging in the diagnosis of physical elder abuse: Results of a qualitative study with radiologists and frontline providers Pediatric radiologists play a key role in the detection of child abuse through the identification of characteristic injury patterns.

S. L. Frazão; A. M. Correia; P. Norton; T. Magalhães,2015,medical,English,Physical abuse against elderly persons in institutional settings,"People over 65 years old are expected to be an increasing group exposed to abuse. Despite the well-studied intra-familial abuse, institutional abuse still lacks a proper understanding about its determinants and characteristics. The general objective of this study is to provide a better knowledge about physical abuse against elderly people in institutional settings, in order to contribute to a timely detection, correct forensic diagnosis and prevention of these cases. A retrospective study was conducted through the analysis of forensic medical exams performed in the North Forensic Medical Services of Portugal, between 2004 and 2013, to elderly persons allegedly victims of physical abuse in an institutional setting by a caregiver (n = 59). All the alleged cases occurred in nursing homes and in most of them (93.2%) the charges were against the institution and not focussing on a particular individual. The alleged victims were mainly female (79.7%), 75 years or older (75.9%), presenting a severe disability (55.9%) and 47.2% being unable to communicate. No injuries or post-traumatic pain were found in 55.9% of the cases to support the charge of physical abuse. Only in 6.8% of the cases were the forensic medical findings suggestive of physical abuse and, although this was not the object of the examination, 69.1% were considered suggestive or highly suggestive of neglect. A statistically significant association was found between the alleged victim's degree of disability and the occurrence of neglect (p = 0.003). The sample's size seems to be underestimated, probably due to lack of detection and/or reporting. The condition of these persons, mainly related with their inability to perceive abusive behaviours and/or to disclose them (mostly by physical and/or mental disability), as well as their reluctance to press charges due to fear of reprisal, affects significantly the detection and diagnosis of physical abuse, particularly in whom injuries are not obvious. In anticipation to the rapid ageing of the population, it is urgent to analyse and understand this emerging issue so that social policies and regulation may be developed, in an effort to protect the elderly, as well as to make improvements in the professionals' skills.","Physical abuse against elderly persons in institutional settings People over 65 years old are expected to be an increasing group exposed to abuse.

In conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, 217 women residing across the United States who are at least 55 years of age and who have a relative with PD completed an online survey. Analyses found that in the past 6 months 15% of survey respondents experienced physical abuse committed by their relative with PD, 20% experienced financial abuse, and 42% experienced psychological abuse. Given these high rates of abuse it is imperative that research into factors predicting abuse be conducted, as such information would help target and determine the nature of interventions.","Physical, financial, and psychological abuse committed against older women by relatives with psychiatric disorders: Extent of the problem Persons with psychiatric disorders (PD) are known to be at an increased risk of committing elder abuse, with much of this abuse occurring toward women.

Lachs,2021,medical,English,Identifying patterns of health care utilisation among physical elder abuse victims using Medicare data and legally adjudicated cases: protocol for case-control study using data linkage and machine learning,"Physical elder abuse is common and has serious health consequences but is under-recognised and under-reported. As assessment by healthcare providers may represent the only contact outside family for many older adults, clinicians have a unique opportunity to identify suspected abuse and initiate intervention. Preliminary research suggests elder abuse victims may have different patterns of healthcare utilisation than other older adults, with increased rates of emergency department use, hospitalisation and nursing home placement. Little is known, however, about the patterns of this increased utilisation and associated costs. To help fill this gap, we describe here the protocol for a study exploring patterns of healthcare utilisation and associated costs for known physical elder abuse victims compared with non-victims. We hypothesise that various aspects of healthcare utilisation are differentially affected by physical elder abuse victimisation, increasing ED/hospital utilisation and reducing outpatient/primary care utilisation. We will obtain Medicare claims data for a series of well-characterised, legally adjudicated cases of physical elder abuse to examine victims’ healthcare utilisation before and after the date of abuse detection. We will also compare these physical elder abuse victims to a matched comparison group of non-victimised older adults using Medicare claims. We will use machine learning approaches to extend our ability to identify patterns suggestive of potential physical elder abuse exposure. Describing unique patterns and associated costs of healthcare utilisation among elder abuse victims may improve the ability of healthcare providers to identify and, ultimately, intervene and prevent victimisation. This project has been reviewed and approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Review Board, protocol #1807019417, with initial approval on 1 August 2018. We aim to disseminate our results in peer-reviewed journals at national and international conferences and among interested patient groups and the public.","Identifying patterns of health care utilisation among physical elder abuse victims using Medicare data and legally adjudicated cases: protocol for case-control study using data linkage and machine learning Physical elder abuse is common and has serious health consequences but is under-recognised and under-reported.

Unfortunately, family members are frequently perpetrators of elder family financial exploitation (EFFE). To understand possible EFFE precursors, the Elder Family Financial Exploitation Survey (EFFES) collected hierarchical data (individual relatives nested within families) including respondent and elder demographics, financial exploitation details if it occurred, and family dynamics (general family functioning, fairness conflict, resource exchange patterns, entitlement attitudes, and communication/problem-solving). Multilevel logistic regression models found positive association with greater fairness conflict and entitlement attitudes, and negative association with general family function, resource exchange expectations, and communication patterns when growing up, but no association with current communication. Findings can prompt families to proactively address negative family dynamics to reduce the risk of EFFE. Results may also inform decisions about appointing other fiduciaries, e.g., trustees, and personal representatives (executors).","Family dynamics and their association with elder family financial exploitation in families with appointed powers of attorney Powers of attorney (POA), widely used in end-of-life planning, give authority, often to relatives, to manage elders’ affairs if they become incapacitated.

To understand possible EFFE precursors, the Elder Family Financial Exploitation Survey (EFFES) collected hierarchical data (individual relatives nested within families) including respondent and elder demographics, financial exploitation details if it occurred, and family dynamics (general family functioning, fairness conflict, resource exchange patterns, entitlement attitudes, and communication/problem-solving). Multilevel logistic regression models found positive association with greater fairness conflict and entitlement attitudes, and negative association with general family function, resource exchange expectations, and communication patterns when growing up, but no association with current communication. Findings can prompt families to proactively address negative family dynamics to reduce the risk of EFFE. Results may also inform decisions about appointing other fiduciaries, e.g., trustees, and personal representatives (executors).",family dynamics association elder family financial exploitation families appointed powers attorney powers attorney poa widely endoflife planning authority relatives manage elders affairs incapacitated unfortunately family members frequently perpetrators elder family financial exploitation effe understand possible effe precursors elder family financial exploitation survey effes collected hierarchical data individual relatives nested families including respondent elder demographics financial exploitation details occurred family dynamics general family functioning fairness conflict resource exchange patterns entitlement attitudes communicationproblemsolving multilevel logistic regression models found positive association greater fairness conflict entitlement attitudes negative association general family function resource exchange expectations communication patterns growing association current communication findings prompt families proactively address negative family dynamics reduce risk effe results inform decisions appointing fiduciaries eg trustees personal representatives executors,family dynamics association elder family financial exploitation families  powers attorney powers attorney  widely endoflife planning authority relatives manage elders  incapacitated unfortunately family members frequently perpetrators elder family financial exploitation effe understand possible effe  elder family financial exploitation survey  collected hierarchical data individual relatives nested families including respondent elder demographics financial exploitation details occurred family dynamics general family functioning fairness conflict resource exchange patterns entitlement attitudes  multilevel logistic regression models found positive association greater fairness conflict entitlement attitudes negative association general family function resource exchange expectations communication patterns growing association current communication findings prompt families  address negative family dynamics reduce risk effe results inform decisions   eg  personal representatives ,family dynamics association elder family financial exploitation families appointed       endoflife   relatives manage elders affairs   family members frequently perpetrators elder family financial exploitation      elder family financial exploitation survey  collected  data  relatives  families including  elder  financial exploitation   family dynamics  family   conflict resource  patterns  attitudes   logistic    positive association   conflict  attitudes  association  family  resource    patterns growing association   findings  families  address  family dynamics  risk  results        representatives

Center team members gather information and make decisions designed to protect clients and their assets, yet the collective process of how these case reviews are conducted remains unexamined. The purpose of this study is to present a model describing the interprofessional approach of investigation and response to financial exploitation (FE), a frequent and complex type of abuse of vulnerable adults. To develop an understanding of the case review process at the Los Angeles County Elder Abuse Forensic Center (Center), a quasi-Delphi field study approach was used involving direct observations of meetings, surveying team members, and review from the Center’s Advisory Council. The goal of this iterative analysis was to understand the case review process for suspected FE in Los Angeles County. A process map of key forensic center elements was developed that may be useful for replication in other settings. The process map includes: (a) multidisciplinary data collection, (b) key decisions for consideration, and (c) strategic actions utilized by an interprofessional team focused on elder justice. Elder justice relies on a complex system of providers. Elder abuse forensic centers provide a process designed to efficiently address client safety, client welfare, and protection of assets.

This study sought to describe the variation in appraisals of perceived EM seriousness among victims of emotional abuse, physical abuse, and neglect and to examine factors that influence varying appraisals using neutralization theory. Data came from a subsample of EM victims (n = 191) drawn from a representative, population-based study (n = 4,156) of community-dwelling, cognitively intact older adults in New York State. The Conflict Tactics Scale and Duke Older Americans Resources and Services scales were adapted to assess EM. Subjective appraisal of abuse/neglect was measured according to ordinal levels of victim-perceived seriousness and predicted using ordinal regression. Emotional abuse was appraised less seriously among victims who were both functionally impaired and dependent upon the perpetrator, lived with the perpetrator, and of increasing age. Emotional abuse was perceived with greater seriousness among victims enduring more frequent/varied abuse and when the perpetrator was distally-related. Neglect was appraised with lower seriousness among female victims and greater seriousness if perpetrated by a paid homecare attendant or in scenarios involving more frequent/varied unmet needs. Findings carry implications for understanding victim help-seeking behavior and informing EM measurement.","Varying Appraisals of Elder Mistreatment Among Victims: Findings from a Population-Based Study Prior elder mistreatment (EM) research has not examined subjective assessments of problem seriousness from the perspective of victims.

This study uses data from a 10-year, prospective, population-based study of EM to determine the adjusted effects of EM on older adult mortality, after controlling for other health and socioeconomic covariates. The New York State Elder Mistreatment Prevalence Study conducted a random-sample telephone survey of older adults (n = 4 156) in 2009 (Wave 1). The current study employs EM and covariate data from Wave 1 and data on mortality status through Wave 2 (2019). EM was operationalized both as experiencing EM and as severity of EM. The survey measured overall EM and separate subtypes (emotional, physical, and financial abuse, and neglect). The hypothesis was not supported that abused and neglected older people would have higher rates of death over the study. Individuals who were victims of EM were no more likely to die over the following 10 years, compared with those who were not mistreated, after controlling for covariates. Furthermore, the severity of EM, as measured by the frequency of mistreatment behaviors, also was not associated with mortality risk. The finding that self-reported EM did not raise the risk of earlier death in this sample is encouraging. Future research should work to identify factors that may moderate the relationship between EM and mortality, such as social support/isolation, quality of family relationships, or involvement with formal support service systems.","Lack of association of elder mistreatment with mortality Prior research is limited and inconsistent on the degree to which elder mistreatment (EM) is associated with mortality.

Previous studies have shown that elder abuse forensic centers—multidisciplinary teams that help investigate and respond to elder mistreatment—increase prosecution rates by enhancing teamwork across agencies. Research is needed to identify what aspects of this intervention model lead to better elder justice outcomes. Six District Attorneys (DAs) were interviewed about their experiences working with other agencies at an elder abuse forensic center (the “Center”) and how participating in case discussions influenced their professional perspectives on elder abuse. Transcripts were analyzed qualitatively revealing three themes: (1) “goal-driven” versus “mission-driven” professional orientations; (2) role blurring; and (3) value added from participating in the Center team. Important factors for increasing rates of prosecution were: (1) having key decision-makers present at the meeting; (2) the forensic expertise provided by the geriatrician and neuropsychologist; and (3) cross-discipline learning. Influenced by the other disciplines, DAs sought goals beyond prosecution as the default approach to resolving elder financial abuse and advocated for interventions that could best respond to the victim’s needs, such as restitution or protection.","Prosecutors’ perspectives on elder justice using an elder abuse forensic center Prosecution is a rare outcome in elder financial exploitation.

"Gil, Ana Paula;Capelas, Manuel Luis",2022,social science,English,Elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes as a reciprocal process: the view from the perspective of care workers,"Reciprocal abuse inside care practices remain under-studied due to their invisibility and further research is required. The purpose of this paper is to explore different levels of conflicts inside organisations. The paper is based on a self-administered questionnaire filled out by care workers (n = 150), in 16 Portuguese care homes. Results indicated that, overall, 54.7% of care workers had observed abuse, in their daily practice, in the preceding 12 months: 48.7% psychological; 36.0% neglectful care practices; 14.0% physical and 3.3% financial abuse. The figures decreased significantly as regards abuse committed themselves, with 16.7% of those admitting to having committed at least one of these behaviours. The highest figures were also recorded for psychological abuse (13.3%) and neglect (6.7%). However, there is a statistically significant relationship between abuse committed by care workers and abuse committed by residents. Overall, 52.0% of care workers reported having been the target of at least one such behaviour by residents. This paper has its limitations as the sample consisted of only 16 nursing homes (12 not-for-profit and 4 for-profit nursing homes). The fact that only 4 of the 16 LTC homes were for-profit is a potential limitation both in general and in particular because research has shown that lower quality of care and elder abuse and neglect are more common in for-profit nursing homes at least in Portugal. The results were also based on self-reported measures. A reactive behaviour, the risk of retaliation, after a complaint, the difficulty in dealing with dementia and the residents' aggressive behaviour, an absence of a training and support policy in an environment where difficult working conditions prevail, are factors enhancing a reciprocal process of abuse. The analysis followed by a discussion of potential implications to prevent institutional elder abuse and neglect, based on communication and social recognition, including better working conditions and training, and a cooperative work environment. Conflict is much more than reducing an interpersonal relationship problem between residents and staff (care workers, professional staff, managers) and extending to the whole organisation. Therefore, there are still uncertainties on how organisations, staff and residents interact between themselves, and affect care practises. Reciprocal abuse in nursing homes is an important area of research and this paper enabled a discussion of potential implications concerning the quality of care, which required the identification of levels of conflict, in an organisational system, including interactions, the context where care is provided, difficult working conditions, lack of training and levels of support. All these factors are important when considering elder abuse and neglect and this calls for special attention by policymakers and researchers.","Elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes as a reciprocal process: the view from the perspective of care workers Reciprocal abuse inside care practices remain under-studied due to their invisibility and further research is required.

This study aimed to determine the types and risk factors of elder abuse in KSA. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted of abuse among the elderly (65 years and older; n  = 128) reported in the National Family Safety Registry (NFSR) between April 2017 and December 2021. Most cases involved women (65.6%) and married individuals (54.7%). Physical abuse was the most common type (44.5%), followed by neglect (34.4%). Men, married individuals, people without family support, and people with physical disabilities were more likely to experience physical abuse. Elderly people, single individuals, women, and those lacking family support showed an increased likelihood of neglect. Preventive strategies should be implemented through awareness raising, capacity building, resource allocation, and the exchange of multidisciplinary good practices across sectors.","Determining patterns and types of violence against the elderly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Reports indicate an increase in the incidence of violence against the elderly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

J. P. Meyer; K. Isaacs; O. El-Shahawy; A. K. Burlew; W. Wechsberg,2019,medical,English,Research on women with substance use disorders: Reviewing progress and developing a research and implementation roadmap,"Research on women with substance use disorders has expanded, yet knowledge and implementation gaps remain. Drawing from topics discussed at the 2017 meeting of InWomen’s in Montreal, Canada, this article reviews key progress in research on substance use among women, adolescents, and families to delineate priorities for the next generation of research. The field has seen significant accomplishments in multiple domains, including the management of pregnant women with substance use and comorbid psychiatric disorders, caring for neonates in opioid withdrawal, greater inclusion of and treatment options for LGBTQ + communities, gendered instrumentation, and gender-focused HIV interventions for adolescent girls and women. Women who use alcohol and other drugs often experience other comorbid medical conditions (chronic Hepatitis C and HIV), contextual confounders (intimate partner violence exposure, homelessness, trauma), and social expectations (e.g., as caretakers) that must be addressed as part of integrated care to effectively treat women’s substance use issues. Although significant advances have been made in the field to date, gender-based issues for women remain a neglected area in much of substance abuse research. Few dedicated and gender-focused funding opportunities exist and research has been siloed, limiting the potential for collaborations or interdisciplinary cross-talk. Given renewed attention to substance use in the context of the burgeoning opioid epidemic and shifts in global politics that affect women’s substance use, the field requires a strategic rethink to invigorate a pipeline of future research and researchers.","Research on women with substance use disorders: Reviewing progress and developing a research and implementation roadmap Research on women with substance use disorders has expanded, yet knowledge and implementation gaps remain.

R. L. Chapa; B. M. Hicks; T. J. Prihoda; L. A. Smiley; L. M. Englehart; M. V. Taverna,2019,medical,English,Extent of Elder Abuse Training in Dental Hygiene Curricula and Program Directors' Perceptions of Importance of and Barriers to Implementation,"Research published in 2002 reported limited elder abuse training in U.S. dental hygiene curricula although its importance has increased with an aging population. The aims of this study were to determine the current extent of elder abuse training in U.S. dental hygiene curricula and to explore dental hygiene program directors’ perspectives on the topic. A 25-item online survey was distributed to all 361 program directors, coordinators, and/or department chairs of Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA)-accredited dental hygiene programs via email in August 2017. A response rate of 27.2% (n=98) was achieved. A large percentage of the respondents (83.3%) included elder abuse training in their program curricula; for most (58.7%), one to three curriculum hours were spent on the topic. A large percentage (89%) agreed the topic was at least somewhat important to include, and 29.5% said a personal or professional elder abuse experience influenced the depth of instruction at their program. Various barriers to inclusion were identified. At least 40% of these educators perceived their graduates to be appropriately competent in their ability to recognize elders’ oral neglect (63.5%) and general neglect (48.7%) and to document potential signs of elder abuse (43.8%). Lower percentages perceived that their graduates were competent in the areas of communication regarding elder abuse (21.9%) and reporting suspected abuse (32.4%). Despite rising awareness about elder abuse among dental hygienists and widespread incorporation of the subject in dental hygiene curricula, these results suggest that there are still deficiencies in training. To prepare dental hygiene graduates to confidently recognize and respond to elder abuse, educators should seek to overcome barriers by modifying instruction and embracing interprofessional collaboration.","Extent of Elder Abuse Training in Dental Hygiene Curricula and Program Directors' Perceptions of Importance of and Barriers to Implementation Research published in 2002 reported limited elder abuse training in U.S. dental hygiene curricula although its importance has increased with an aging population.

Conrad,2018,social science,English,Using Latent Class Analysis to Identify Profiles of Elder Abuse Perpetrators,"Research suggests that abuser risk factors differ across elder mistreatment types, but abuse interventions are not individualized. To move away from assumptions of perpetrator homogeneity and to inform intervention approaches, this study classifies abusers into subtypes according to their behavior profiles. Data are from the Older Adult Mistreatment Assessment administered to victims by Adult Protective Service (APS) in Illinois. Latent class analysis was used to categorize abusers (N = 336) using victim and caseworker reports on abusers’ harmful and supportive behaviors and characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to determine which abuser profiles are associated with 4 types of mistreatment—neglect, physical, emotional, and financial—and other sociodemographic characteristics. Abusers fall into 4 profiles descriptively labeled “Caregiver,” “Temperamental,” “Dependent Caregiver,” and “Dangerous.” Dangerous abusers have the highest levels of aggression, financial dependency, substance abuse, and irresponsibility. Caregivers are lowest in harmful characteristics and highest in providing emotional and instrumental support to victims. The 4 profiles significantly differ in the average age and gender of the abuser, the relationship to victims, and types of mistreatment committed. This is the first quantitative study to identify and characterize abuser subtypes. Tailored interventions are needed to reduce problem behaviors and enhance strengths specific to each abuser profile.","Using Latent Class Analysis to Identify Profiles of Elder Abuse Perpetrators Research suggests that abuser risk factors differ across elder mistreatment types, but abuse interventions are not individualized.

E. Caspi,2017,health/care,English,A federal survey deficiency citation is needed for resident-to-resident aggression in U.S. nursing homes,"Resident-to-resident aggression (RRA) in nursing homes is a prevalent and concerning public health problem. A rapid growth in the number of research studies has led to advancements in understanding and awareness of these incidents. However, no state survey deficiency citation (F-Tag) currently exists to capture RRA in a structured way in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) nursing homes F-Tags Coding System. This omission represents a major barrier to State Survey Agencies, CMS, consumers, and care advocacy organizations’ efforts to keep vulnerable and frail residents safe and free from psychological harm. The commentary makes the case for development and implementation of a new RRA-specific F-Tag by identifying 20 problem areas and the ways in which this F-Tag could address them. The new F-Tags Coding System (part of the new Federal Nursing Home regulations) represents a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to bridge this major gap in practice, research, and policy.","A federal survey deficiency citation is needed for resident-to-resident aggression in U.S. nursing homes Resident-to-resident aggression (RRA) in nursing homes is a prevalent and concerning public health problem.

Evidence suggests that R-REM, such as verbal, physical, and sexual conflict between residents, is a common and pervasive issue. This review examines the frequency with which R-REM occurs in RAC services; identifies the types of R-REM that occur; and provides an overview of the reported characteristics of both the victim and perpetrator involved in the R-REM event. A systematic review was conducted. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Ageline, and Cochrane Library to identify qualitative and quantitative studies published in the English language. Residents living in RAC services. Data on frequency and characteristics were collated, and aggregate proportions were calculated where possible. Twenty-six studies were identified; most (n = 20) were published in the United States. The overall proportion of residents engaged in R-REM was provided by 7 quantitative studies with the estimated frequency reported to be 12% to 23%. For qualitative studies, the number of care staff reporting to have observed R-REM ranged from 18.7% to 98.0%. Physical and verbal abuse were the most commonly reported types of mistreatment. Characteristics of the perpetrator of R-REM were reported in 12 (46.2%) studies. Overall, the mean age of perpetrators was 80.93 years, most were men (83.2%), and 64.4% had dementia and/or Alzheimer diagnosis. Characteristics of the victim and the history of R-REM were largely omitted from the published studies. The findings from the review broaden understanding on the extent of R-REM; the individual and event characteristics and ultimately support care planning, policy, and direction for future research. To improve understanding, quality of care, and RAC residents’ well-being, further studies are recommended to address the identified gaps in knowledge.","Resident-to-Resident Elder Mistreatment in Residential Aged Care Services: A Systematic Review of Event Frequency, Type, Resident Characteristics, and History Resident-to-resident elder mistreatment (R-REM) between residents living in residential aged care (RAC) services is a challenging issue in relation to the care of older people.

Ninety-seven CNAs (34.4%) reported actions responding to R-REM incidents involving 182 residents (10.8%), describing 22 different responses. Most common were physically intervening/separating residents (51), talking calmly to settle residents down (50), no intervention (39), and verbally intervening to defuse the situation (38). Less common were notifying a nurse (13) or documenting in behavior log (4). Nursing home staff report many varied responses to R-REM, a common and dangerous occurrence.

"Caspi, Eilon",2018,health/care,English,The circumstances surrounding the death of 105 elders as a result of resident-to-resident incidents in dementia in long-term care homes,"Resident-to-resident incidents in dementia in long-term care homes resulting in deaths represent a growing concern among residents, family members, care providers, care advocacy organizations, and policy makers. Despite these concerns and experts’ predictions by which injurious and fatal incidents will increase in the coming years due to the projected growth in the number of people with dementia, no studies have been conducted in North America on these fatal incidents. This exploratory pilot study makes first steps towards bridging this major gap in research and practice. Using publicly available information (primarily newspaper articles and death review reports), practically useful patterns were identified pertaining to the circumstances surrounding the death of 105 elders as a result of these incidents. The findings could inform various efforts to prevent future deaths in similar circumstances, keep vulnerable and frail residents safe, and encourage researchers to examine risk and protective factors for these incidents.","The circumstances surrounding the death of 105 elders as a result of resident-to-resident incidents in dementia in long-term care homes Resident-to-resident incidents in dementia in long-term care homes resulting in deaths represent a growing concern among residents, family members, care providers, care advocacy organizations, and policy makers.

The aim of the present study was to explore characteristics of older patients with fractures that increase the likelihood that the fracture was associated with abuse. This is a retrospective chart review study of 1,000 patients aged 65 and older who presented to an emergency department in northern-central Israel with a fracture during 2019. The chart review included participant characteristics – sociodemographic data, medical data, data regarding the fracture, and data on the presence of forensic markers of elder abuse in individual patients. Descriptive statistics and regression models were used for the analyses. Older age, presence of dementia, and hand and facial fractures were associated with the presence of forensic markers, and were also found to predict having at least one forensic factor. This study provides further support for the creation of clinical guidelines for identification of elder abuse.","Retrospective study of older patient characteristics that increase the likelihood that a fracture was associated with abuse Searching for clinical manifestations of elder abuse may help healthcare professionals identify cases of elder abuse.

SV was measured using behaviourally specific questions based on a broad definition of SV. Participants were selected via a cluster random probability sampling with a random route finding approach. Information on sexual victimisation, correlates, assailant characteristics and framing was collected via structured face-to-face interviews with adults aged 70 years and older living in Belgium (community-dwelling, assisted living and nursing homes).

Female sex and a higher number of sexual partners were associated with lifetime SV (p < .05), non-heterosexual sexual orientation with past 12-months SV (p < .05). Correlates identified to be linked to elder abuse and neglect in previous studies were not linked with SV in our sample. ‘Someone unknown’ was identified as most common assailant.

"Hiyoshi-Taniguchi, Kazuko;Becker, Carl B.;Kinoshita, Ayae",2014,medical,English,Social workers can use sense of coherence to predict burnout of end-of-life care-givers (research report from Japan),"Social workers are deeply involved in supporting elder persons' home care-givers, who frequently border on burnout or nervous breakdown. Since social workers cannot fully assist every family caring for frail elders at home, it is valuable to pre-identify those care-givers in greatest need of social work support. Previous research suggests that care-givers' sleep interruption is a major factor in their sense of burden, but this alone proves inadequate to discriminate those in need of extra social work support. We hypothesised that care-givers' Sense of Coherence (SOC) was the major factor in their sense of burden. With co-operation of social workers in rural and urban Japan, we surveyed care-givers' SOC and sense of burden. Our study of 177 family care-givers showed that a high SOC substantially mitigated their sense of burden, while care-givers with low senses of meaning felt more burdened. This suggests that social workers should administer a simple SOC test to home care-givers in order to predict those care-givers most needful of social work assistance during End-of-Life (EOL) home care. Moreover, if social workers could elevate home care-givers' SOC through social support or programmes of exercise or meditation, this might reduce home care-givers' sense of burden, ultimately reducing burnout, neglect and abuse of homebound elderly.","Social workers can use sense of coherence to predict burnout of end-of-life care-givers (research report from Japan) Social workers are deeply involved in supporting elder persons' home care-givers, who frequently border on burnout or nervous breakdown.

Similar tools do not yet exist for older adults and elder abuse. To (1) use insights from experts to develop a tool to assist clinicians in appropriately and completely documenting physical findings in injured older adults for potential future forensic investigation of abuse or neglect and (2) to assess the feasibility of incorporating this tool into clinical practice. Two-phase, exploratory qualitative study. Phase 1: individual interviews with elder abuse experts from various specialties in medicine and criminal justice. Phase 2: focus groups with anticipated end users of the tool. Phase 1 telephone-based key informant interviews were conducted with 11 elder abuse experts (2 detectives, 3 prosecutors, 1 forensic pathologist, 2 geriatricians, and 3 emergency medicine physicians). Phase 2 focus groups were conducted among emergency medicine (n = 10) and primary care (n = 8) providers. Key informant interviews were conducted telephonically while the two focus groups were held in-person at an emergency medicine site in New York, NY, and a primary care site in Los Angeles, CA. Experts agreed that medical providers’ documentation of geriatric injuries is usually inadequate for investigating alleged elder abuse/neglect. They highlighted elements needed for forensic investigation: initial appearance before treatment is initiated, complete head-to-toe evaluation, documentation of all injuries (even minor ones), and documentation of pertinent negatives. Several noted the value of photographs to supplement written documentation. End users identified practical challenges to utilizing a tool, including the burden of additional or parallel documentation in a busy clinical setting, and how to integrate it into existing electronic medical records. A practical tool to improve medical documentation of geriatric injuries for potential forensic use would be valuable. Practical challenges to utilization must be overcome.","Developing the Geriatric Injury Documentation Tool (Geri-IDT) to Improve Documentation of Physical Findings in Injured Older Adults Standardization in tools and documentation of child abuse and intimate partner violence have proven helpful in completely documenting injuries and suspected abuse among these populations.

We test this theory using nationally representative, longitudinal data from 2,261 older adults in the National Social Life Health and Aging Project. We regress psychological and physical health in 2010/2011 on verbal and financial mistreatment experience in 2005/2006 and find that the mistreated have more anxiety symptoms, greater feelings of loneliness, and worse physical and functional health 5 years later than those who did not report mistreatment. In particular, we show a novel association between financial mistreatment and functional health. Contrary to the stress buffering hypothesis, we find little evidence that social support moderates the relationship between mistreatment and health. Our findings point to the lasting impact of mistreatment on health but show little evidence of a buffering role of social support in this process.","Elder mistreatment predicts later physical and psychological health: Results from a national longitudinal study Stress process theory predicts that elder mistreatment leads to declines in health, and that social support buffers its ill effects.

"Friedman, Lee;Avila, Susan;Friedman, Daniel;Meltzer, Wendy",2019,medical,English,Association between type of residence and Clinical Signs of Neglect in older adults,"Studies have demonstrated that measures of lower quality of care and associated adverse health effects are more prevalent in for-profit nursing homes compared to not-for-profit facilities. However, these studies omit persons who receive care in the community setting, and exclusively focus on isolated clinical signs that may obscure the true effect size, since these clinical signs rarely occur in isolation. In this study, we use the Clinical Signs of Neglect Scale (CSNS), which is an aggregate measure of clinical signs of neglect and substandard care, to evaluate the association of residence type on health outcomes among individuals living in both private community residences and for-profit and not-for-profit long-term care facilities. In a multicenter, retrospective data analysis of 1,149 patients identified from an inpatient hospital registry, we assessed the relationship between residence type (community dwelling, not-for-profit, and for-profit facilities) and clinical signs of neglect. Adjusted parameter estimates and 95% CIs were estimated with linear regression in 3 models using different reference groups. The most serious clinical signs were consistently more prevalent among residents of for-profit facilities, as were measures of poor institutional quality. Relative to low-functioning community-dwelling patients, the mean difference in CSNS scores was higher among patients residing in not-for-profit facilities by 1.99 (p = 0.012) and 3.55 (p ≤ 0.001) among patients in for-profit facilities. In a separate model, the mean difference in CSNS scores among patients living in for-profit facilities compared to not-for-profit facilities was 1.90 (p = 0.035). Using an aggregate measure, our findings support prior studies demonstrating an association between residence type and adverse health outcomes for disabled elderly.","Association between type of residence and Clinical Signs of Neglect in older adults Studies have demonstrated that measures of lower quality of care and associated adverse health effects are more prevalent in for-profit nursing homes compared to not-for-profit facilities.

"Chang, Miya",2016,social science,English,Experience of elder abuse among older Korean immigrants,"Studies on the scope and nature of Asian American elder abuse conducted with older immigrants are extremely limited. The overall purpose of this study was to examine the extent and type of elder abuse among older Korean immigrants, and to investigate critical predictors of elder abuse in this population. The sample consisted of 200 older Korean immigrants aged 60 to 90 years who resided in Los Angeles County in 2008. One of the key findings indicated that 58.3% of respondents experienced one or more types of elder abuse. Logistic regression indicated that the victims’ health status and educational level were statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of experiencing abuse. The present study, although limited in sample size, measures, sampling methods, and population representation, has contributed to this important area of knowledge. It is recommended that future studies conduct research on elder abuse with more representative national samples that can measure the extent of abuse and neglect more accurately.","Experience of elder abuse among older Korean immigrants Studies on the scope and nature of Asian American elder abuse conducted with older immigrants are extremely limited.

Cross-sectional data were collected on 948 cases with yes/no substantiation decisions where 357 cases had no abuse in elder mistreatment investigations. Hypotheses were tested using odds ratios, bivariate, and multiple linear regression analyses including a control for victim vulnerability. Of 948 alleged victims, 42 (4.4%) exhibited signs of substance use problems. Among the 323 alleged perpetrators, 87 (26.9%) were reported to have substance use problems. Substance use problems by alleged perpetrators were associated (p < .01) with financial exploitation, physical abuse, and emotional abuse but not neglect. Substance use problems by alleged victims were associated with neglect, but not the other types. Alleged perpetrators with substance use problems tended to commit multiple forms of abuse, were male and not caregivers. Except for the findings on neglect, the associations with elder mistreatment were stronger for alleged perpetrators with substance use problems, than for alleged victims.

Developing a better understanding of the extent of the problem is an important step toward preventing it. We conducted a global systematic review and meta-analysis of existing prevalence studies, in multiple languages, that occurred in the community settings from inception to June 26, 2015, in order to determine the extent of abuse against women aged 60 years and over. To disentangle the wide variations in prevalence estimates, we also investigated the associations between prevalence estimates and studies’ demographic and methodological characteristics. A total of 50 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The combined prevalence for overall elder abuse in the past year was 14.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) [11.0, 18.0]). Pooled prevalence for psychological abuse was 11.8% (95% CI [9.2%, 14.9%]), neglect was 4.1% (95% CI [2.7%, 6.3%]), financial abuse was 3.8% (95% CI [2.5%, 5.5%]), sexual abuse was 2.2% (95% CI [1.6%, 3.0%]), and physical abuse was 1.9% (95% CI [1.2%, 3.1%]). The studies included in the meta-analysis for overall abuse were heterogeneous indicating that significant differences among the prevalence estimates exist. Significant associations were found between prevalence estimates and the following covariates: World Health Organization–defined regions, countries’ income classification, and sample size. Together, these covariates explained 37% of the variance. Although robust prevalence studies are sparse in low- and middle-income countries, about 1 in 6, or 68 million older women experience abuse worldwide. More work is needed to understand the variation in prevalence rates and implications for prevention.","The Prevalence of Self-Reported Elder Abuse Among Older Women in Community Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis The abuse of older women appears to be a significant problem.

To identify forms of abuse and ill-treatment in the elderly, as well as the determinants of these abuses. This is a quantitative study, of the non-experimental, descriptive, cross-sectional type attended by 135 Portuguese elderly. It uses the Family APGAR Scale and the Question to Elicit Elder Abuse (QEEA), which was applied between January and June 2013, in the elderly residing in the central of Portugal. The data shows that 23.5% of the elderly have suffered some kind of abuse, these being especially of the emotional kind and neglect. We also found that the most abused elders were unmarried and widows, those who had lower academic qualifications, those who reported feeling lonely and less healthy and even those who perceive to integrate families with some degree of dysfunction. We found that the abuse and mistreatment are present in the everyday life of many seniors and are a difficult subject to approach. The evidence, invite us to reflect on the development of intervention strategies, particularly at the levels of emotional abuse, neglect, promotion of health and family functioning in order to contribute to the reduction or extinction of abuse and ill-treatment in the elderly.","Abuse and maltreatment in the elderly The aging population is increasing worldwide, but the abuse and mistreatment in the elderly (often silenced forms) has also been increasing, with strong implications for their quality of life.

Statistically, the highest percentage of violence in the form of arrogance, vulgarity and blackmail, threats was recorded in people aged 60–65 (48.9 % and 56.3 %, respectively). On the other hand, logistic regression analysis showed that the oldest respondents aged >70 more than three times more often than people from the youngest age category are victims of violence. The rate of arrogance, vulgarity (odd ratio (OR) 2.90;p < 0.01) and mocking (OR 3.56; p < 0.01) is statistically significantly higher, respectively, in people living in towns than in villages.

"Jönson, Håkan",2016,social science,English,Framing scandalous nursing home care: What is the problem?,"The aim of this article is to investigate different ways in which nursing home scandals in Sweden have been framed, to discuss the relations between these existing frameworks, and to identify ways of describing the problem that are absent in the current debates. Data for the study consisted of media articles, television documentaries and internet debates, expert reports and court hearings, and interviews with representatives of organisations dealing with the issue of mistreatment in care services for older people. An analytical tool developed within social movement research was used to identify three ‘debates’ on such mistreatment in Sweden, where competing ways of framing the problem have been used: (a) a debate where staff are cast as either perpetrators or victims, (b) a debate on privatisation and profit as the motive for neglect of care recipients, and (c) a debate on deserving and non-deserving recipients of socially provided care centred around populist claims. The analysis highlights a need to introduce an alternative frame for interpretation where mistreatment in care for older people is regarded as involving scandalous cases of ageism. This anti-ageism frame would provide older people with a lead role in the drama – not just as victims but as stakeholders in relation to the problem.","Framing scandalous nursing home care: What is the problem?

The research included four in-depth focus groups consisting of 19 multidisciplinary auditors. The qualitative analysis was encoded in stages with repeated comparisons between individual participants and within groups and led to three main themes: 1 Failure in addressing basic, personal, and social needs of residents in nursing homes; 2 Mistreatment manifested in violation of residents’ privacy and human dignity, neglect, and physical harm; 3 Abuse, including psychological, financial, and physical abuse. The findings can be explained by the characteristics of nursing homes as total institutions, as well as perceptions of ageism and de-humanization of the residents. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of the auditing role in monitoring the nursing homes’ quality of care and the safety of the residents.","“They just did what they usually do”: Mistreatment, abuse, and neglect in nursing homes from the perspective of Ministry of Health auditing teams The aim of this article was to examine how Ministry of Health auditing teams experience quality of care, mistreatment, abuse, and neglect in nursing homes in Israel.

"Goldblatt, Hadass;Band-Winterstein, Tova;Alon, Sara",2018,health/care,English,Social Workers’ Reflections on the Therapeutic Encounter With Elder Abuse and Neglect,"The aim of this qualitative study was to explore social workers’ reflections on their experience of the therapeutic encounter with victims and perpetrators of elder abuse and neglect. The research questions were as follows: How do social workers tune themselves toward the therapeutic encounter with elder abuse? How do they position themselves vis-à-vis the clients? How do social workers describe the meaning of the intervention both for the clients and for themselves? What is the added value of the therapeutic encounter in this field for the social workers? Participants were 17 experienced women social workers, who worked with abusers and with abused and neglected older adults in Israel. Data were collected via in-depth semi-structured interviews, which were later transcribed and content analyzed. Two main themes emerged from the findings, emphasizing two key aspects of the social workers’ reflective process experienced during the therapeutic encounter: (a) focus on the client: “This is the journey of their lives”—reflection on the therapeutic “journey”; (b) focus on the social worker’s inner and professional world: “‘There is nothing to be done’ is no longer in my vocabulary”—a personal and professional maturation process. The social workers expressed a positive attitude toward their elder clients. A unique dialogue developed in the therapeutic encounter, whereby the social workers considered any change as valuable if it allowed the elders a sense of control and self-worth, whereas the social workers were enriched by the elders’ life experience, and matured both personally and professionally. Thus, both sides benefited from this reciprocal relationship. Implications for further research and practice are discussed.","Social Workers’ Reflections on the Therapeutic Encounter With Elder Abuse and Neglect The aim of this qualitative study was to explore social workers’ reflections on their experience of the therapeutic encounter with victims and perpetrators of elder abuse and neglect.

This research is a cross-sectional study. The participants of the study were an elderly population who applied to one ‘family health centre’. The study was completed with the participation of 332 people. The study was carried out between June and July 2021. A questionnaire form, Geriatric Mistreatment Scale (GMS), Hwalek–Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test (H-S/EAST), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used in the study. According to the GMS, 16.0% of the participants experience abuse. Psychological abuse (6.92%) was the highest according to the GMS sub-dimensions. This was followed by physical abuse (6.6%), neglect (1.8%), economic abuse (1.5%), and sexual abuse (1.5%). According to H-S/EAST, 22.9% of participants experience abuse. The perpetrators of abuse are mostly spouses, children and relatives of the elderly. There is a negative correlation between the H-S/EAST score and the SWLS score. Uneducated elderly people are exposed to abuse more than primary education graduates. Compared to the elderly living in a nuclear family, more abuse is seen in extended families and those living alone. The fact that the houses in which the elderly live are not physically suitable increases the risk of abuse. Identifying and trying to minimise local risk factors for elder abuse can help reduce the prevalence of abuse. We hope that these data will be a guide for future intervention studies.","Elderly abuse, affecting factors and evaluation of life satisfaction: a cross-sectional study The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of abuse and its effect on life satisfaction in older adults living in our region.

"Malmedal, Wenche;Anyan, Christiana",2020,health/care,English,Elder abuse in Ghana – a qualitative exploratory study,"The aim of this study was to explore how Ghanaian staff in nursing homes and hospitals perceive abuse and neglect of older adults as well as to explore the nature and scope of abuse and neglect of older adults as it exists in Ghana. This exploratory study used a qualitative research methodology that sets out to explore staff’s perception of elder abuse in nursing homes and hospitals in Ghana. Five nursing assistants and two caregivers were interviewed in two nursing homes and four nurses were interviewed in one hospital. A semi-structured interview guide was used for data collection. The findings showed that elder abuse occurs in both hospitals and nursing homes, which might be attributed to different personal, situational and institutional characteristics as well as cultural and traditional value systems. Various factors at the level of interpersonal relationships contributed to elder abuse. Situational characteristics such as aggressive exchanges between residents and health workers and institutional characteristics such as limited facilities and resources to care for residents are all factors that were implicated in elder abuse. Finally, culture and traditional views, beliefs system and socioeconomic factors seem to be implicated in elder abuse and neglect. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that explores elder abuse and neglect in Ghanaian nursing homes and hospitals.","Elder abuse in Ghana – a qualitative exploratory study The aim of this study was to explore how Ghanaian staff in nursing homes and hospitals perceive abuse and neglect of older adults as well as to explore the nature and scope of abuse and neglect of older adults as it exists in Ghana.

Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was performed according to the qualitative method. Three main themes emerged: ageism and neglect as the everyday routine (neglect is built into institution life on the platform of ageism); how the institutional system promotes neglect—between institutional and personal ageism (the ways institutions promote neglect in the shadow of ageism); from vision to reality—how neglect can be prevented in an ageist reality. The attempt to demonstrate the link between ageism and neglect and suggesting how to include them as interrelated phenomena in health care provision programs could promote older persons’ quality of life.,Health Care Provision for Older Persons: The Interplay Between Ageism and Elder Neglect The aim of this study was to explore the link between neglect and ageism in health care provision for older persons.

Identifying characteristics of elder abuse during COVID-19 is critically important. This study characterized and compared elder abuse patterns across two time periods, a one-year period during the pandemic, and a corresponding one-year period prior to the start of the pandemic. Contacts (including social media contacts, and email; all referred to as “calls” for expediency) made to the National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) resource line were examined for differences in types of reported elder abuse and characteristics of alleged perpetrators prior to the pandemic (Time 1; March 16, 2018 to March 15, 2019) and during the pandemic (Time 2; March 16, 2020 to March 15, 2021). Calls were examined for whether or not abuse was reported, the types of reported elder abuse, including financial, physical, sexual, emotional, and neglect, and characteristics of callers, victims, and alleged perpetrators. Chi-square tests of independence compared frequencies of elder abuse characteristics between time periods. In Time 1, 1401 calls were received, of which 795 calls (56.7%) described abuse. In Time 2, 1009 calls were received, of which 550 calls (54.5%) described abuse. The difference between time periods in frequency of abuse to non-abuse calls was not significant. Time periods also did not significantly differ with regard to caller, victim, and perpetrator characteristics. Greater rates of physical abuse and emotional abuse were reported during Time 2 after adjustment for multiple comparisons. An increased frequency of multiple forms of abuse was also found in Time 2 compared to Time 1. Findings suggest differences in specific elder abuse subtypes and frequency of co-occurrence between subtypes between time periods, pointing to a potential increase in the severity of elder abuse during COVID-19.","Elder abuse in the COVID-19 era based on calls to the National Center on Elder Abuse resource line The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated circumstances that place older adults at higher risk for abuse, neglect, and exploitation.

"Emily Cousins, Kay de Vries, Karen Harrison Dening",2021,social science,English,Ethical care during COVID-19 for care home residents with dementia,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on care homes in the United Kingdom, particularly for those residents living with dementia. The impetus for this article comes from a recent review conducted by the authors. That review, a qualitative media analysis of news and academic articles published during the first few months of the outbreak, identified ethical care as a key theme warranting further investigation within the context of the crisis. To explore ethical care further, a set of salient ethical values for delivering care to care home residents living with dementia during the pandemic was derived from a synthesis of relevant ethical standards, codes and philosophical approaches. The ethical values identified were caring, non-maleficence, beneficence, procedural justice, dignity in death and dying, well-being, safety, and personhood. Using these ethical values as a framework, alongside examples from contemporaneous media and academic sources, this article discusses the delivery of ethical care to care home residents with dementia within the context of COVID-19. The analysis identifies positive examples of ethical values displayed by care home staff, care sector organisations, healthcare professionals and third sector advocacy organisations. However, concerns relating to the death rates, dignity, safety, well-being and personhood – of residents and staff – are also evident. These shortcomings are attributable to negligent government strategy, which resulted in delayed guidance, lack of resources and Personal Protective Equipment, unclear data, and inconsistent testing. Consequently, this review demonstrates the ways in which care homes are underfunded, under resourced and undervalued.","Ethical care during COVID-19 for care home residents with dementia The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on care homes in the United Kingdom, particularly for those residents living with dementia.

"Adinkrah, Mensah",2020,social science,English,Grannicides in Ghana: A study of lethal violence by grandchildren against grandmothers,"The current article presents the results of an exploratory research that examined 16 homicides perpetrated by grandchildren against their own grandmothers in Ghana, West Africa. The term grannicide was coined by the present author and employed in the current analysis to denote the slaying of a grandmother by her grandchildren. Data for the present study were extracted from various Ghanaian print and electronic media. Results from the analysis of data show that grannicide is gendered, with all 16 identified grannicides perpetrated by grandsons against grandmothers. Offenders typically were young and of low socioeconomic background. Victims were of advanced age, poor, and at least partially dependent on their children and grandchildren for economic, physical and social support. All the homicides occurred in the rural areas of the country, and the victims commonly shared a residence with the assailant. Witchcraft accusations were the predominant motive in grandchild-to-grandmother slayings. The killings were overwhelmingly brutal, exhibiting characteristics that criminologists call overkill. Recommendations for reducing this type of crime are offered.","Grannicides in Ghana: A study of lethal violence by grandchildren against grandmothers The current article presents the results of an exploratory research that examined 16 homicides perpetrated by grandchildren against their own grandmothers in Ghana, West Africa.

"Wen, Jing;Yang, Hang;Zhang, Qianhan;Shao, Jingjin",2022,social science,English,Understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on vulnerability to fraud among older adults,"The current study aimed to clarify the relationships among loneliness, susceptibility to persuasion, self-control, and vulnerability to fraud among older adults. Especially, we wanted to investigate whether susceptibility to persuasion mediates the association between loneliness and vulnerability to fraud, and whether self-control moderates the relationship in this process. A moderated mediation model was examined with 252 Chinese older adults (Mage = 67.94, SD = 6.27) who completed questionnaires regarding loneliness, susceptibility to persuasion, self-control, and vulnerability to fraud. The results revealed that loneliness significantly predicted older adults’ vulnerability to fraud and susceptibility to persuasion partially mediated this relationship. Moreover, this mediating effect was only significant for older adults with low self-control. These findings enrich our understanding of how loneliness affects older adults’ vulnerability to fraud and provide practical guidance for establishing protections against fraud targeting older adults.","Understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on vulnerability to fraud among older adults The current study aimed to clarify the relationships among loneliness, susceptibility to persuasion, self-control, and vulnerability to fraud among older adults.

Information on elder mistreatment was collected from 400 non-randomly selected cognitively intact older adults in a residential area of Singapore. Items on mistreatment were adopted from the Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test and the Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale. Standardized scales on activities of daily living, loneliness, and items on violence between family members were administered. The prevalence rate of mistreatment was 8.3%. A family environment characterized by psychological and physical abuse between family members and a social environment characterized by loneliness increased the vulnerability of older adults to mistreatment. Older adults who were mistreated reported more depression symptoms than those who were not.","Prevalence and correlates of elder mistreatment in Singapore The current study attempts to identify the prevalence rate of and risk factors associated with elder mistreatment in Singapore, a multi-ethnic nation in South-East Asia.

J. Myhre; S. Saga; W. Malmedal; J. Ostaszkiewicz; S. Nakrem,2020,health/care,English,Elder abuse and neglect: an overlooked patient safety issue. A focus group study of nursing home leaders' perceptions of elder abuse and neglect,"The definition and understanding of elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes can vary in different jurisdictions as well as among health care staff, researchers, family members and residents themselves. Different understandings of what constitutes abuse and its severity make it difficult to compare findings in the literature on elder abuse in nursing homes and complicate identification, reporting, and managing the problem. Knowledge about nursing home leaders’ perceptions of elder abuse and neglect is of particular interest since their understanding of the phenomenon will affect what they signal to staff as important to report and how they investigate adverse events to ensure residents’ safety. The aim of the study was to explore nursing home leaders’ perceptions of elder abuse and neglect. A qualitative exploratory study with six focus group interviews with 28 nursing home leaders in the role of care managers was conducted. Nursing home leaders’ perceptions of different types of abuse within different situations were explored. The constant comparative method was used to analyse the data. The results of this study indicate that elder abuse and neglect are an overlooked patient safety issue. Three analytical categories emerged from the analyses: 1) Abuse from co-residents: ‘A normal part of nursing home life’; resident-to-resident aggression appeared to be so commonplace that care leaders perceived it as normal and had no strategy for handling it; 2) Abuse from relatives: ‘A private affair’; relatives with abusive behaviour visiting nursing homes residents was described as difficult and something that should be kept between the resident and the relatives; 3) Abuse from direct-care staff: ‘An unthinkable event’; staff-to-resident abuse was considered to be difficult to talk about and viewed as not being in accordance with the leaders’ trust in their employees. Findings in the present study show that care managers lack awareness of elder abuse and neglect, and that elder abuse is an overlooked patient safety issue. The consequence is that nursing home residents are at risk of being harmed and distressed. Care managers lack knowledge and strategies to identify and adequately manage abuse and neglect in nursing homes.","Elder abuse and neglect: an overlooked patient safety issue.

Levy,2020,social science,English,COVID-19 and ageism: How positive and negative responses impact older adults and society,"The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults’ mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.","COVID-19 and ageism: How positive and negative responses impact older adults and society The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs.

"Huang, Wan;Chen, Xiaojin;Wu, Yuning",2023,social science,English,Tough or no love? Parental migration and children’s exposure to corporal punishment and neglect in rural China,"The effects of parental migration on behavioral and psychological outcomes of children left behind (LBC) in rural China have drawn much public and research attention. Surprisingly, despite much research attention to this highly disadvantaged group, we know little about whether parental migration and alternative caretaking arrangements influence the exposure of this group to corporal punishment and neglect – key predictors of a myriad of child developmental outcomes such as educational performance, delinquency, and mental wellbeing. To address this research gap, we used a probability sample of approximately 1,200 middle-school students in Jiangxi province to investigate whether parental migration and alternative caretaking arrangements influenced children’s exposure to corporal punishment and neglect. Our models revealed that being taken care of by grandparents significantly decreased the odds of exposure to corporal punishment among children. Meanwhile, our results indicated that child neglect is prevalent among all children regardless of living and caretaking arrangements. Suggesting a protective role that grandparenting plays in LBC families against corporal punishment, these findings enrich the literature on child abuse and neglect in general and contribute to the understanding of the effect of parental migration on LBC’s development and experience in particular. Finally, policy recommendations are offered based on these findings.","Tough or no love?

Community-based data on the prevalence of psychological morbidity, abuse and cognitive dysfunction are scarce. To determine the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction, psychological morbidity and abuse in the elderly population in a resettlement colony from East Delhi, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted on the elderly population of a resettlement colony, in East Delhi, comprising 5 blocks and 12 subblocks with a total population of 65 000. The study was carried out within 2 months from April to August 2017. The self-reported questionnaires were administered to detect cognitive dysfunction, psychological morbidity, social support and pattern of abuse. The mean age of the study subjects was 70.29 years (53.8% were males, 78.8% were married, 86.9% were Hindus and 75% were living with children). A total of 106 subjects (66.6%) belonged to the lower socioeconomic strata with 120 (75%) living with children. Most of the subjects (70.6%) studied below the primary level of education. As detected on Goldberg General Health Questionnaire-12, 56.9% of the subjects had psychological morbidity. On Dementia Assessment by Rapid Test, 33.1% of subjects were screened positive. The pattern of abuse reported was as follows: emotional abuse (16.9%), physical abuse (7.5%), sexual abuse (1.9%) and social neglect (18.1%). The social support score was found to be 46.22 (12.22). The results of this community-based study signify that appropriate steps at the policy level need to be undertaken so that abuse as well as neglect can be prevented. In addition, screening the elderly population helps to detect early cognitive dysfunction, psychological morbidity, abuse victims and individuals with poor support.","Prevalence of cognitive dysfunction, psychological morbidity and abuse in the community-based elderly population in India The elderly population in India is expected to grow enormously by 2050 owing to an increase in life expectancy.

As such, there is now a growing body of research showing that loneliness is negatively related to physical and mental health. More recently, one of the most widely tested models of effort-reward imbalance (ERI) posits that the imbalance between high effort and low reward elicits strong negative emotions and sustained stress responses. Despite these developments, the mechanism between ERI and loneliness of the elderly remains unclear. In the current study, we explored how ERI influences loneliness via social support and control belief in social domain. We selected a convenience sample aged 53–84 years old (N = 231) to complete a series of standard psychological assessments. Multiple mediation analysis showed that (1) the positive effect of ERI on loneliness was partially mediated by social support (95% IC = −.001 to .078) and control belief in social domain (95% IC = .028 to .154), and (2) the chain mediating effect of both mediators was also significant (95% IC = .037 to .112). The study suggests that ERI can influence loneliness through decreasing social support and subsequently reducing control belief in social domain.","The impact of effort-reward imbalance on loneliness of the elderly: The multiple mediation effect of social support and control belief in social domain The empirical studies of loneliness have experienced unprecedented growth in the past decades.

We discuss solutions to research challenges, including the lack of a uniform gold standard for abuse diagnosis and how to ethically recruit subjects who may have cognitive impairment and also be crime victims. We offer recommendations on recruiting and training a specialized health care workforce. We make suggestions for health care providers about how to navigate the legal world including issues with expert testimony and also how to participate in policymaking and development of rational systems. We emphasize the importance of developing and supporting partnerships within the field, with allied fields inside and outside medicine, and internationally.

We emphasize the importance of developing and supporting partnerships within the field, with allied fields inside and outside medicine, and internationally. We highlight the value of connecting researchers and clinicians focused on different types of family violence to learn from each other, given that, in many ways, they’re treating the same disease.",experiences child abuse pediatricians lessons learned inform health care providers focused improving elder abuse geriatrics clinical practice research experience physicians health care providers child abuse pediatrics decades includes successes failures offer critical insights inform growing field health care providers focusing elder abuse clinical practice research methods compare contrast child abuse pediatrics elder abuse geriatrics identify describe detail relevant lessons learned child abuse focus balancing urgent action need robust evidence support clinical conclusions discuss solutions research challenges including lack uniform gold standard abuse diagnosis ethically recruit subjects cognitive impairment crime victims offer recommendations recruiting training specialized health care workforce suggestions health care providers navigate legal world including issues expert testimony participate policymaking development rational systems emphasize importance developing supporting partnerships field allied fields inside outside medicine internationally highlight value connecting researchers clinicians focused different types family violence learn given ways theyre treating disease,experiences child abuse  lessons learned inform health care providers focused improving elder abuse geriatrics clinical practice research experience physicians health care providers child abuse pediatrics decades includes successes failures offer critical insights inform growing field health care providers focusing elder abuse clinical practice research methods compare contrast child abuse pediatrics elder abuse geriatrics identify describe detail relevant lessons learned child abuse focus balancing urgent action need robust evidence support clinical  discuss solutions research challenges including lack uniform gold standard abuse diagnosis  recruit subjects cognitive impairment crime victims offer recommendations  training specialized health care workforce suggestions health care providers  legal world including issues expert testimony participate policymaking development  systems emphasize importance developing supporting partnerships field allied fields inside outside medicine internationally highlight value connecting researchers clinicians focused different types family violence learn given ways theyre treating disease,experiences child abuse pediatricians lessons   health care providers  improving elder abuse geriatrics clinical practice research experience physicians health care providers child abuse pediatrics decades      insights  growing  health care providers  elder abuse clinical practice research methods   child abuse pediatrics elder abuse geriatrics identify    lessons  child abuse   urgent  need  evidence support clinical  discuss  research challenges including     abuse diagnosis   subjects cognitive  crime victims  recommendations  training  health care   health care providers  legal  including issues     development       partnerships      medicine     researchers clinicians    family violence  given ways  treating disease
"Lindenbach, Jeannette;Larocque, Sylvie;Morgan, Debra G.;Jacklin, Kristen",2019,health/care,English,Mistreated older adults with dementia in the home: Practitioner experience and unattainable professional agency,"The experience of practitioners who encounter mistreatment of an older adult with dementia by a caregiver in the home has received little attention in the literature. A critical research methodology aimed to understand the experience of professional agency, the ability to control outcomes and act in a meaningful way, of health and social service practitioners when encountering these cases in the home. Fifty-one practitioners from urban, rural and Northeastern communities in Ontario participated in semi-structured interviews, reflective journals, as well as focus group discussions. Theoretical thematic analysis of data led to the discovery of five themes: weathering the storm to realization; cognitive uncertainty; emotional upheaval; one’s inability to resolve the mistreatment; and the double-edge sword of self-reflection. Understanding this experience is an essential step toward improving practice and policy, and achieving positive outcomes for the mistreated older adult with dementia and their caregiver within the home.","Mistreated older adults with dementia in the home: Practitioner experience and unattainable professional agency The experience of practitioners who encounter mistreatment of an older adult with dementia by a caregiver in the home has received little attention in the literature.

The purpose of the screen was to evaluate the decisional abilities and vulnerability to exploitation of older adults. Adults aged 60 and over were interviewed by social, legal, financial, or health services professionals who underwent in-person training on the administration and scoring of the scale. Professionals provided a rating of the decision-making abilities of the older adult. The analytic sample included 213 individuals with an average age of 76.9 (SD = 10.1). The majority (57%) were female. Data were analyzed using item response theory (IRT) methodology. The results supported the unidimensionality of the item set. Several IRT models were tested. Ten ordinal and binary items evidenced a slightly higher reliability estimate (0.85) than other versions and better coverage in terms of the range of reliable measurement across the continuum of financial incapacity.","Item response theory analysis of the Lichtenberg Financial Decision Screening Scale The focus of these analyses was to examine the psychometric properties of the Lichtenberg Financial Decision Screening Scale (LFDSS).

M. C. Lin,2020,social science,English,"Communication neglect, caregiver anger and hostility, and perceptions of older care receivers' cognitive status and problem behaviors in explaining elder abuse","The goal of the current study was to examine the roles of communication neglect and caregiver traits (i.e., anger and hostility) in explaining caregivers’ tendency to engage in abusive behaviors – specifically, whether such tendency is likely to occur in situations where caregivers perceive older care receivers displaying cognitive impairment or problem behaviors. Two hundred fifty-five informal caregivers completed an online questionnaire via Qualtrics. Treating communication neglect as the mediator, and caregiver anger and hostility as moderators, the results suggested that caregivers who perceived their older care receivers displaying problem behaviors were more likely to engage in communication neglect, which then led to psychological abuse. Moreover, the joint effects of communication neglect and caregiver anger and hostility intensified caregivers’ likelihood to commit psychological abuse. These findings provide initial evidence to further investigate the importance of communication neglect and dysfunctional behaviors such as anger and hostility in explaining psychological abuse in informal caregiving for older adults.","Communication neglect, caregiver anger and hostility, and perceptions of older care receivers' cognitive status and problem behaviors in explaining elder abuse The goal of the current study was to examine the roles of communication neglect and caregiver traits (i.e., anger and hostility) in explaining caregivers’ tendency to engage in abusive behaviors – specifically, whether such tendency is likely to occur in situations where caregivers perceive older care receivers displaying cognitive impairment or problem behaviors.

"Sooryanarayana, Rajini",2016,health/care,English,"Elder abuse among rural community dwellling elders in Kuala Pilah District, Negeri Sembilan State, Malaysia","The increasing ageing population, coupled with urbanisation, rapid development and changes in the traditional family structure has led to various conflicts within families, social networks and health care systems. As Malaysia is fast approaching an ageing nation status, the health, safety and welfare of elders are major concerns to society. Elder abuse and neglect is a phenomenon recognised in some parts of the world but less so locally. This is the first community based study to be undertaken on elder abuse in Malaysia. To describe the prevalence of elder abuse among rural community dwelling elders, determine associated factors; describe the pattern of disclosure of abuse and the characteristics of perpetrators. This study consisted of three phases. Phase one was a systematic review on the prevalence and measurement of elder abuse. Phase two was a pilot study, validating the questionnaire to be used in the next phase. Phase three was a cross-sectional study conducted in the community of Kuala Pilah district, Negeri Sembilan state, which consisted predominantly of rural populace. A total of 2,496 elders were approached in a multi-stage random sample of community dwelling elders in selected households using the sampling frame of the national census provided by the Department of Statistics, Malaysia. Face-to-face interviews guided by a structured questionnaire were conducted over a period of six months from November 2013 to May 2014. Cognition, depression, anxiety, stress, physical health status, mental health status, disability, physical function, mobility-disability and risk of social isolation were assessed, besides chronic disease, current employment, and history of abuse, among other sociodemographic features. The prevalence of overall abuse was reported to be 4.5% in the past 12 months, with psychological abuse being the most common form followed by financial, physical, neglect and sexual abuse. In the multivariate analysis, males (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.05-3.06), secondary or higher level education (aOR 2.13, 95% CI 1.03-4.42), poor mental health status (aOR 4.14, 95% CI 2.18-7.87), risk of social isolation (aOR 2.67, 95% CI 1.42-5.02), a prior history of abuse (aOR 4.29, 95% CI 1.72-10.69) and depressive symptoms (aOR 11.78, 95% CI 4.08-34.06) were found to be associated with overall abuse. Most elders disclosed abusive events to other family members, with various actions ensuing to approach or avoid the perpetrator. Perpetrators tended to be males and from amongst family members, specifically adult children, with abuse usually occurring at the elder's home. Elder abuse occurred among one in every twenty elders. Early screening especially for elders with depressive symptoms, poorer mental health status and prior history of abuse may help to identify elders at risk of elder abuse. Home visits may be helpful to detect elders at risk of isolation. Improving social support of elders can alleviate the burden of family caregivers, especially as perpetrators are largely family members. A multidisciplinary effort by social and health care workers with better legal provisions would serve to help prevent this phenomenon from occurring and better protect those affected, with future research specifically looking into this issue.","Elder abuse among rural community dwellling elders in Kuala Pilah District, Negeri Sembilan State, Malaysia The increasing ageing population, coupled with urbanisation, rapid development and changes in the traditional family structure has led to various conflicts within families, social networks and health care systems.

Data from transcripts were analyzed to identify themes. Participants identified challenges faced by APS (e.g., clients less willing to engage with APS, inability to perform necessary job tasks remotely, and low staffing levels) as well as strategies APS used in response (e.g., increasing collaboration with other community-based programs and service providers, enabling remote court hearings through technology and in-person facilitation, and ensuring staff had access to personal protective equipment). These findings may inform APS planning for future large-scale societal disruptions.","Adult Protective Services Perspectives on Responding to Elder Abuse and Serving Clients During the COVID-19 Pandemic The initial COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures dramatically impacted Adult Protective Services (APS), requiring rapid adjustments.

The purpose of this study was to examine financial circumstances of older adults in the program and to explore how the program could better support their financial well-being. Individual, in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 older adults who attended the program provided by a local agency in northern Texas. Three themes emerged when exploring financial circumstances of the participants: (1) victims of financial fraud scams, (2) struggles with money management, and (3) inability to make ends meet. The program has been serving older adults, particularly ethnically diverse older adults and low-income older adults who may not have access to financial education workshops or seminars provided by private financial institutions. The Money Smart for Older Adults Program was perceived as helpful among the participants because it raised awareness of the importance of their financial well-being and it also supported their financial decision making.","The Money Smart for Older Adults program: A qualitative study of the participants’ financial well-being The Money Smart for Older Adults is a program that is tailored to older adults to raise awareness for the risk of financial exploitation and teach them how to plan and make informed financial decisions.

Our aim is to determine the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test (H-S/EAST). The H-S/EAST (15-itemed, three-dimensional: direct abuse, characteristics of vulnerability, and potentially abusive situation) was translated according to the guidelines and experts evaluated it for content validity and cultural adaptation. Participants' (n = 252) mean age was 73.4 ± 6.4 years and 58.3% were female. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Older Adults Module (WHOQOL-OLD) and the Barthel Index were used for validity. Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency, exploratory factor analysis for content validity, t-test for construct validity, and discriminant ability were used. SPSS 15.0 was used for analysis and statistical significance was P < 0.05. In test-retest reliability, internal consistency coefficient values for direct abuse, characteristics of vulnerability, and potentially abusive situation were 0.88, 0.73, and 0.80, respectively. Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency of the H-S/EAST was 0.741. Exploratory factor analysis obtained 5 factors, and explained variance was 61.8%.

M. J. Danesh; A. L. Chang,2015,medical,English,The role of the dermatologist in detecting elder abuse and neglect,"The National Research Council of the National Academies defines elder mistreatment as: (1) intentional actions that cause harm or create serious risk of harm (whether or not harm is intended) to a vulnerable elder by a caregiver or other person who stands in a trust relationship to the elder; or (2) failure by a caregiver to satisfy the elder's basic needs or to protect the elder from harm. Estimates of the prevalence of elder abuse have ranged from 2.2% to 18.4%. Dermatologists are uniquely positioned to identify and manage suspected cases of elder abuse given their expertise in distinguishing skin lesions of abuse from organic medical disease and their patient populations with strong elderly representation. This article discusses aspects of both the screening and management of elder abuse with particular relevance to dermatologists. Like physicians across medical specialties, dermatologists must be familiar with those aspects of elder abuse in screening, diagnosis, management, and reporting that are unique to their field and to those aspects that are applicable to all health care providers.","The role of the dermatologist in detecting elder abuse and neglect The National Research Council of the National Academies defines elder mistreatment as: (1) intentional actions that cause harm or create serious risk of harm (whether or not harm is intended) to a vulnerable elder by a caregiver or other person who stands in a trust relationship to the elder; or (2) failure by a caregiver to satisfy the elder's basic needs or to protect the elder from harm.

This study examined the dissemination and implementation of the Guidelines across APS programs in the US. Researchers used the Diffusion of Innovations Theory to develop a survey sent to APS directors in all states. Forty-two states responded, and results were used to select a subset of states in which to conduct in-depth interviews. Awareness of the Guidelines was widespread but varied. Reported use of the Guidelines indicates that states are working to incorporate them into their practices.

J. J. Arias; L. Morgado; S. G. Prost,2023,medical,English,Forgotten and without Protections: Older Adults in Prison Settings,"The number of older adults incarcerated in prisons is growing significantly, and there is a great need for legal authority, processes, and resources to mitigate individual and social burdens of elder neglect and abuse within these settings. Older adults in prison may be particularly vulnerable to abuse, neglect, or exploitation. They are dependent on the carceral system for basic resources, are at risk for retaliatory actions for reporting mistreatment, and bear disproportionately high health burdens. This essay first considers standards and resources for mitigating elder mistreatment in the community and residential-care settings in contrast to the available resources in prisons. Arguing that a conceptual model of elder abuse tailored to the prison population is needed, the essay proposes a research agenda through which such a model could be developed. The model could then be used in the creation of policy for detecting and mitigating elder mistreatment of incarcerated people. The essay concludes with a call to action to address the rift in legal protections and processes that leave older adults in prison at increased risk of abuse and neglect without a clear pathway for recourse.","Forgotten and without Protections: Older Adults in Prison Settings The number of older adults incarcerated in prisons is growing significantly, and there is a great need for legal authority, processes, and resources to mitigate individual and social burdens of elder neglect and abuse within these settings.

This study was conducted to assess the reasons why older people chose to move to old age homes, the status and forms of abuse they experienced, and the risk factors associated with their abuse before moving to old age homes. This study was a cross sectional study conducted among older adults currently residing in all the old age homes of Pokhara Lekhnath Metropolitan City. Complete enumeration of the respondents was done and data was collected consecutively, using a semi-structured interview schedule, from all older adults aged 60 years and above who had been living in the homes for at least a month. The total sample size was 109. The collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression was used as an inferential statistics to determine the predictors of abuse. A majority of the respondents (56.0%) came to old age homes on their own volition, 24.7% reported that they came to the homes because they were physically weak and they had no one to care for them at their residence, while 11% reported that they were forcefully sent by their caregivers. Out of total respondents, 60.6% reported that they experienced some form of abuse before they came to the old age home: most frequent was caregiver neglect (34.9%) and verbal abuse (34.9%), while few experienced financial abuse (2.8%). Women were at a higher risk of abuse than men (p<0.05, OR = 4.430, CI = 1.695–11.577) prior to their transfer to old age homes. A majority of the older adults who transferred to old age homes in Pokhara Lekhnath Metropolitan city had been earlier abused by their caregivers, mainly through neglect and verbal abuse, and women were at a higher risk for abuse than men.","Abuse of older adults before moving to old age homes in Pokhara Lekhnath Metropolitan City, Nepal: A cross-sectional study The number of older individuals relocating from their homes to old age homes is increasing in Nepal.

The caregivers were selected from outpatient neurology clinics and associations of relatives of people with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. A comprehensive sociodemographic questionnaire was administered to all participants, and several standardized scales were used to assess burden, anxiety, depression, social support and resilience. The “Psychological Aggression” and “Physical Assault” dimensions of the Revised Conflicts Tactics Scale were used as risk factors of caregivers’ maltreatment for the construct validation. To establish the probability of maltreatment, a latent class analysis was carried out according to the item responses obtained from the CASE. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) of the CASE was 0.71. The construct validity was explored through factorial analysis, and we found that two dimensions of CASE—i.e., interpersonal abuse and neglect/dependency—explained 62.5% of the variability. According to the latent class probabilities, 20.4% of participants were categorized as possible abusers and 21.4% as non-abusers. The optimal maltreatment cutoff point was six points on the CASE. The validation of the CASE provides us a brief and easy instrument for detecting possible cases of maltreatment of Spanish people with dementia.","Detection of maltreatment of people with dementia in Spain: Usefulness of the Caregiver Abuse Screen (CASE) The objective of our study is to validate the Caregiver Abuse Screen (CASE) as an instrument for detecting the maltreatment of people with dementia in Spain.

In the largest prospective cohort to date, we interviewed carers from 97 care home units (baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16 months) about quality of life (DEMQOL-Proxy) and agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory) of 1483 residents living with dementia. At baseline, we interviewed 1566 carers about coping strategies (Brief COPE), averaging scores across care home units. Carer dysfunctional coping strategies did not predict resident quality of life over 16 months (0.03, 95% CI −0.40 to 0.46). Lower resident quality of life was longitudinally associated with worse Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory score (−0.25, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.23). Survival was not associated with carer dysfunctional coping, resident quality of life, or agitation scores. Carer dysfunctional coping did not predict resident quality of life. Levels of resident agitation were consistently high and related to lower quality of life, over 16 months. Lack of association between carer dysfunctional coping and resident quality of life may reflect the influence of the care home or an insensitivity of aggregated coping strategy scores. The lack of relationship with survival indicates that agitation is not explained mainly by illness.

We conducted a secondary data analysis of 21,718 women aged 60 years and older. Older women with disabilities had higher prevalences of CA, IPV, and EA than those with some difficulties or without disabilities. In older women whose disability was acquired at birth or due to aggression, this prevalence was especially high. Older women with disabilities and a history of CA and IPV were twice as likely to suffer EA.

Mirzaei,2023,health/care,English,The prevalence of elder abuse and risk factors: a cross-sectional study of community older adults,"The old people population is increasing worldwide. Along with their increasing population, an increase in elder abuse cases is predicted. Elder abuse is a neglected problem, and many cases go unreported. This study was conducted to identify types of elder abuse and examine associated risk factors. This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 500 older people in Ardabil (northwestern Iran). Data was collected over three months, from June to September 2020. Data was collected using a demographic information form and the Domestic Elder Abuse questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22). Logistic regression was used to identify factors related to elder abuse. The results showed that out of the 500 participants, 258 (51.6%) were male, and 242 (48.2%) were female. Among the 500 participants, 377 individuals (75/4%) reported experiencing at least one type of abuse in the past year. The highest rate of elder abuse was observed for emotional neglect (47.2%) and psychological abuse (40.8%), while the lowest rate was measured for rejection (15.4%) and physical abuse (12.4%). The results indicated that elder abuse was significantly associated with chronic illness (OR = 0.601, 95% CI: 0.391–0.922) and having 1–4 children (OR = 1.275, 95% CI: 1.137–1.430). Considering the high level of elder abuse and its dangerous effects on the quality of life for older people, it is essential to develop appropriate programs to increase awareness among older people and their families.","The prevalence of elder abuse and risk factors: a cross-sectional study of community older adults The old people population is increasing worldwide.

"Melchiorre, Maria Gabriella;Penhale, Bridget;Lamura, Giovanni",2014,social science,English,"Understanding elder abuse in Italy: Perception and prevalence, types and risk factors from a review of the literature","The paper aims to perform a review of studies on elder abuse in Italy. Hand searching was undertaken of grey literature and reviews of published papers concerning local, national, and cross-national studies, both in Italian and English languages. Inferences mainly about perception and prevalence, types and risk factors, but also concerning victims and perpetrators when data were available, have been derived through the quantitative and qualitative information collected. On the whole, elder abuse in Italy, with a prevalence rate around 10–14%, is characterized by more female victims, especially in the oldest age groups. The risk of psychological abuse is highest, but the level of financial mistreatment is also high. In domestic settings, difficulties of overburdened family caregivers have been associated with the existence of possible episodes of abuse, which often remain hidden. In institutional settings, neglect of dependent persons, expired medications and lack of hygienic conditions represent the most common forms of reported abuse, uncovered with the help of police inspections. In both settings, the use of physical restraints emerges as an area of concern. Although caution is needed in relation to generalization, the available data suggest the existence of a widespread phenomenon of elder abuse in Italy. But more in-depth research is needed to provide further evidence and to raise the currently relatively low general and professional awareness of elder abuse. Moreover, a dedicated legal framework and protocol for tackling and preventing the phenomenon, and ad hoc support services for the victims, need to be urgently addressed.","Understanding elder abuse in Italy: Perception and prevalence, types and risk factors from a review of the literature The paper aims to perform a review of studies on elder abuse in Italy.

"Briggs, Mike;Cooper, Adi",2018,health/care,English,Making Safeguarding Personal: Progress of English local authorities,"The paper reports on the findings of a survey of 115 (76 per cent) of English local authorities in 2016 which compared progress on the implementation of the Making Safeguarding Personal (MSP) approach in local authorities through their Adult Social Care departments and in relation to their area Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs) and partner organisations. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the survey in relation to personalised social care and its impact on organisations, their staff and service users, and conclude with wider implications and recommendations for further work. A series of guided interviews were conducted with safeguarding leads from a sample comprising of 115 (76 per cent) of English local authorities during May and June 2016. The sample was randomly picked and balanced to give a fair representation of the different types of councils. The interviews were conducted by a team of five people. All interviewers had in-depth experience of adult safeguarding and were currently practicing independent chairs of SABs. The interviewers followed a prepared schedule consisting of a mixture of open and closed questions. All interviews were held over the phone and averaged one-hour duration. The results pointed to the impression that the majority of local authorities had completed the first step of introducing MSP, i.e. they had trained their workers and modified their systems. Most local authorities were moving into the next phase of embedding user-focussed work into their practice and culture, and were at various points along that journey. However, most had still to engage partner organisations beyond a mere acceptance of MSP as “a good thing”. The research has wide ranging implications for organisations and their workers in the field of adult safeguarding based on its findings. Its limitations are that only organisational leaders and managers were interviewed, although reference is extensively made to initiatives that engage service users. The authors acknowledged the possible bias of interviewees when judging the performance of their own service and attempted to moderate their views in the final report. The report references many practical implications to improve the practice of adult safeguarding in an attempt to make it more person-centred. Examples of good practice are given and recommendations are made to organisations. It is recognised that there are many people who may be at risk of harm through their environmental, personal, age or disability-related situations. In improving the way that services respond to their needs, they will be made to feel safer and their lives enhanced. This original research follows up previous research in the preceding year. It is the widest ranging in its coverage of 76 per cent of English local authorities. Its value is that it measures progress towards full implementation of MSP; reports information and views from safeguarding leaders; and makes 20 recommendations to improve the implementation of MSP within local authorities, SABs and their partners.","Making Safeguarding Personal: Progress of English local authorities The paper reports on the findings of a survey of 115 (76 per cent) of English local authorities in 2016 which compared progress on the implementation of the Making Safeguarding Personal (MSP) approach in local authorities through their Adult Social Care departments and in relation to their area Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs) and partner organisations.

"Goldblatt, Hadass;Band-Winterstein, Tova;Lev, Sagit;Harel, Dovrat",2022,health/care,English,“Who would sexually assault an 80-year-old woman?”: Barriers to exploring and exposing sexual assault against women in late life,"The phenomenon of Sexual Assault against Women in Late Life (SAWLL) has received increasing research attention in recent years. Yet, there is still only scant knowledge on it, compared with research on the sexual assault of younger women. Sexual assault is considered a sensitive topic, generally characterized by a conspiracy of silence. The aim of this article is to explore the barriers that hinder the identification and exposure of SAWLL, as reported by professionals. The research question was as follows: How do welfare and health care professionals present the motives and processes that obstruct exploring, exposing, and intervening in cases of SAWLL? A qualitative research design was used. Participants were 18 experienced welfare and health care professionals engaged in intervention with sexual assault in late life victims as well as offenders. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, which were later transcribed and thematically analyzed. Four themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) Leading Negative Emotions, (b) Lack of Language, (c) Implications of Cumulative and Complex Trauma, and (d) Social Exclusion. Women and professionals alike undergo complementary processes involving silence and silencing. These processes construct a “wall” of barriers, requiring professionals’ sensitivity and awareness to deconstruct these barriers. Professional intervention through open discourse with the abused women can break this conspiracy of silence. We recommend that training programs for professionals intervening in cases of elder abuse and neglect will be directed along two paths: The first path should focus on professionals’ competence and skills, and the second path should address the women’s specific needs. These programs will include a particular module that will specifically address SAWLL. This module should comprise knowledge on typical emotional reactions to SAWLL, the use of language in creating reality, cumulative and complex trauma, and the social construction of ageism and sexism, which lead to social exclusion.","“Who would sexually assault an 80-year-old woman?”: Barriers to exploring and exposing sexual assault against women in late life The phenomenon of Sexual Assault against Women in Late Life (SAWLL) has received increasing research attention in recent years.

This study examined the characteristics of victims and persons of interest (POIs) suspected and/or charged with perpetrating a domestic violence-related crime in residential care facilities. The study employed a text mining method that extracted key information from 700 police-recorded domestic violence events in NSW residential care facilities. Victims were mostly female (65.4%) and older adults (median age 80.3). POIs were predominantly male (67.0%) and were younger than the victims (median age 57.0). While low rates of mental illnesses were recorded (29.1% in victims; 17.4% in POIs), “dementia” was the most common condition among POIs (55.7%) and victims (73.0%). “Physical abuse” was the most common abuse type (80.2%) with “bruising” the most common injury (36.8%). The most common relationship between perpetrator and victim was “carer” (76.6%). These findings highlight the opportunity provided by police text-based data to offer insights into elder abuse within residential care facilities.","Domestic violence in residential care facilities in new South Wales, Australia: A text mining study The police are often the first to attend domestic violence events in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, recording related details as structured information (e.g., date of the event, type of incident, premises type) and text narratives which contain important information (e.g., mental health status, abuse types) for victims and perpetrators.

Abdel Wahab,2020,medical,English,"Knowledge and attitudes regarding elder abuse in the community, Eastern Province Saudi Arabia","The population of old people is increasing world-wide. Along with the increase in their population, an increase in the cases of elder abuse is expected. This study identifies the knowledge of elder abuse and attitudes towards it among the adult attendees of Al Qatif primary health care centers (PHCCs) in Saudi Arabia. In this cross-sectional study, 430 participants at PHCCs, in Al Qatif, in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia completed a questionnaire concerning their knowledge of elder abuse and their attitudes toward the subjects of such abuse. A total of 430 subjects participated in the study. The mean age of the respondents was 35.6 years. Participants included both caregivers (n = 93) and non-caregivers (n = 337). The overwhelming majority of respondents 97% stated that it is their individual responsibility to report elder abuse and neglect if they witness any. Similarly, (91.8%) of the participants agreed that elder abuse and neglect is a criminal act and they have the responsibility to prevent such abuse and neglect. Also, (90.7%) were aware of financial abuse, and (93.5%) believed that using swear words can be considered abuse, as it is not part of their culture. The majority of them (90.5%) agreed that occasional manhandling of the older people is violence/abuse. Most of the participants regarded abuse and neglect of the older people as a serious problem and considered it their responsibility to intervene when they encountered it. Further efforts are required to explore the factors associated with elder abuse to utilize that knowledge in the development of effective interventions to prevent such abuse.","Knowledge and attitudes regarding elder abuse in the community, Eastern Province Saudi Arabia The population of old people is increasing world-wide.

"Shao, Jingjin;Du, Weiping;Lin, Tian;Li, Xiying;Li, Jiamei;Lei, Huijie",2019,social science,English,Credulity rather than general trust may increase vulnerability to fraud in older adults: A moderated mediation model,"The present study aimed to clarify whether it is credulity or general trust that specifically affects vulnerability to fraud, as well as investigating the mediating role of susceptibility to persuasion and the moderating role of greed in this relationship. 254 Chinese older adults completed measures of credulity, general trust, susceptibility to persuasion, greed, and vulnerability to fraud. The results showed that credulity, but not general trust, was positively correlated with vulnerability to fraud, after controlling for demographic covariates. Susceptibility to persuasion partially mediated the effect of credulity on vulnerability to fraud. In addition, this mediating effect of susceptibility to persuasion was only significant in older adults with higher levels of greed. Our findings suggest that credulity, rather than general trust, is a risk factor in vulnerability to fraud among older adults, and may inform the development of supportive interventions to reduce this population’s risk of falling victim to fraud.","Credulity rather than general trust may increase vulnerability to fraud in older adults: A moderated mediation model The present study aimed to clarify whether it is credulity or general trust that specifically affects vulnerability to fraud, as well as investigating the mediating role of susceptibility to persuasion and the moderating role of greed in this relationship. 254 Chinese older adults completed measures of credulity, general trust, susceptibility to persuasion, greed, and vulnerability to fraud.

Our findings suggest that credulity, rather than general trust, is a risk factor in vulnerability to fraud among older adults, and may inform the development of supportive interventions to reduce this population’s risk of falling victim to fraud.",credulity general trust increase vulnerability fraud older adults moderated mediation model present study aimed clarify credulity general trust specifically affects vulnerability fraud investigating mediating role susceptibility persuasion moderating role greed relationship 254 chinese older adults completed measures credulity general trust susceptibility persuasion greed vulnerability fraud results showed credulity general trust positively correlated vulnerability fraud controlling demographic covariates susceptibility persuasion partially mediated effect credulity vulnerability fraud addition mediating effect susceptibility persuasion significant older adults higher levels greed findings suggest credulity general trust risk factor vulnerability fraud older adults inform development supportive interventions reduce populations risk falling victim fraud,credulity general trust increase vulnerability fraud older adults moderated mediation model present study aimed clarify credulity general trust specifically affects vulnerability fraud investigating mediating role susceptibility persuasion moderating role greed relationship  chinese older adults completed measures credulity general trust susceptibility persuasion greed vulnerability fraud results showed credulity general trust positively correlated vulnerability fraud controlling demographic covariates susceptibility persuasion partially mediated effect credulity vulnerability fraud addition mediating effect susceptibility persuasion significant older adults higher levels greed findings suggest credulity general trust risk factor vulnerability fraud older adults inform development supportive interventions reduce populations risk falling victim fraud,   increase vulnerability fraud older adults moderated  model  study        vulnerability fraud investigating mediating role susceptibility   role  relationship  chinese older adults completed measures    susceptibility   vulnerability fraud results       vulnerability fraud controlling demographic  susceptibility    effect  vulnerability fraud addition mediating effect susceptibility   older adults  levels  findings     risk  vulnerability fraud older adults  development  interventions  populations risk  victim fraud

Chi,2017,health/care,English,Prevalence and correlates of abuse screening items among community-dwelling Hong Kong Chinese older adults,"The present study aims to describe the prevalence of potential elder abuse, and to examine correlates of abuse screening items among Chinese community-dwelling older adults. We analyzed the data of 3435 older persons aged ≥60 years who had first applied for the long-term care services in Hong Kong and completed the screening tool (Minimum Data Set–Home Care) in 2006. For each of the five abuse screening items (“fearful of a family member/caregiver,” “unexplained injuries/broken bones/burns,” “physically restrained,” “unusually poor hygiene” and “neglected/abused/mistreated”), we examined its relationship with four types of factors: older person, perpetrator, relationship and environment. The rates of individual abuse screening items ranged from 3.9% for physically restrained to 0.03% for unexplained injures/broken bones/burns. Physically restrained was positively associated with activities of daily living impairments, instrumental activities of daily living impairments, perceived poor health, physically abusive behavior and caregiver mental health. Unusually poor hygiene was positively associated with socially inappropriate behavior and actively resisted care. “Fearful of a family member/caregiver” was positively associated with perceived poor health, conflicting relationship and mental health, and negatively with care activities. Neglected/abused/mistreated was positively associated with age and informal care, and negatively with care activities. We identified a number of associated factors of different abuse screening items among older adults. Our findings could inform healthcare practitioners in identifying those older persons who might be at higher risk of abuse, and provide a knowledge base on which to develop effective preventive measures in the Chinese population.

"O'Connor, Alison M.;Judges, Rebecca A.;Lee, Kang;Evans, Angela D.",2021,social science,English,Can adults discriminate between fraudulent and legitimate e-mails? Examining the role of age and prior fraud experience,"The present study assessed how accurate adults are at detecting fraudulent e-mail activity. A total of 100 younger (18–26 years) and 96 older adults (60–90 years) categorized a series of e-mails as legitimate or fraudulent phishing schemes and self-reported their fraud experiences. Younger and older adults did not differ in accuracy rates when categorizing the e-mails (72%), but older adults used a “high-suspicion” strategy where they were more likely to mislabel a legitimate e-mail as fraudulent compared to younger adults. Younger adults were less likely to be targeted by fraud than older adults, but the groups were victimized at similar rates. Being a prior fraud victim negatively related to e-mail detection performance, but this differed across age groups and the extent of fraud experience. Together, these results provide insight into the relation between fraud experience and the ability to detect e-mail scams and can inform fraud prevention and education initiatives.","Can adults discriminate between fraudulent and legitimate e-mails?

In addition, differential item functioning (DIF) was evaluated in order to examine whether individuals of certain characteristics have a different probability of endorsing certain items even at equivalent levels of the overall construct of neglect. A cross-sectional sample of 686 family members, 388 older adults, and 523 home care workers was drawn. A series of sequentially nested confirmatory factor models was examined to identify whether configural (the same items are associated with the same factor across groups), metric (factors have a similar meaning across groups), and scalar (group means can be meaningfully compared across groups) invariances can be established. Multi indicators multi causes analysis was conducted to identify DIF across age, gender, and education. Five items were adequate indicators of the overall construct. The findings provide support to configural, metric, and scalar invariances across the 3 groups of informants. None of the items resulted in DIF. The findings advocate for the use of the 5-item neglect scale across different groups of informants and call for the evaluation of elder neglect within the constellation of the caregiving unit.","Reports of Elder Neglect by Older Adults, Their Family Caregivers, and Their Home Care Workers: A Test of Measurement Invariance The present study evaluated the measurement invariance of a 7-item scale designed to assess elder neglect across three groups of informants: Older adults, family members, and home care workers.

"Ayalon, Liat",2016,social science,English,A triadic perspective on elder neglect within the home care arrangement,"The present study evaluates a conceptual model of elder neglect within the home care arrangement that takes into consideration the older adult, his or her family members, and the home care worker. Data from 223 complete care-giving units, which consist of an older adult, a family member and a home care worker, were analysed using structural equation modelling. Overall, 31.5 per cent of the older adults, 18 per cent of the care workers and 32.3 per cent of the family members reported at least one type of elder neglect. The proposed model showed a reasonable fit to the data. There was an inverse effect from type of home care to family member's burden and elder neglect, with live-in (around the clock) care being associated with lower levels of family member burden and elder neglect compared with live-out Israeli home care (provided for several hours per week). The amount of informal assistance provided by family members was inversely related to the amount of burden reported by home care workers, with greater informal assistance being associated with lower levels of worker burden. The findings call for the important role of formal home care by demonstrating a potentially protective effect for live-in migrant home care. The study also emphasises the shared burden between formal and informal sources of care.","A triadic perspective on elder neglect within the home care arrangement The present study evaluates a conceptual model of elder neglect within the home care arrangement that takes into consideration the older adult, his or her family members, and the home care worker.

While the Elder Abuse Education group reported less tolerance and intentions for elder abuse compared to the other groups at the immediate posttest, a decrement in such positive changes at 1-month follow-up was observed in such persons. These mixed findings suggest that while specific interventions may reduce elder abuse tolerance, supplemental educational efforts over time may be necessary to maintain intervention-specific gains in intentions and behaviors particular to elder abuse.","The impact of elder abuse education on young adults The present study examined the effectiveness of educational interventions in altering tolerance for and behavioral intentions of elder abuse among college student young adults.

"Wasarhaley, Nesa E.;Golding, Jonathan M.",2017,social science,English,Ageism in the courtroom: mock juror perceptions of elder neglect,"The present study explored ageism in a civil court context. In two experiments, male and female undergraduates (Experiment 1; N = 215) and community members (Experiment 2; N = 203) read an institutional elder neglect trial summary in which a nursing home was sued for failure to provide the necessary care for an elderly female resident. The trial varied as to who provided witness testimony: the live victim, a recorded deposition from the victim, the victim’s middle-aged niece (Experiments 1, 2), the victim’s elderly floor-mate (Experiment 1), or no testimony was provided (Experiment 2). Across both experiments, higher ageism was negatively associated with pro-victim ratings (e.g. victim memory). Ageism indirectly decreased the likelihood of ruling for the plaintiff through ratings of sympathy for the victim and victim memory (Experiment 1), and defendant responsibility (Experiment 2). Trial ratings did not differ based on whether victim testimony was presented live or via recorded deposition (Experiments 1, 2). The results suggest that jurors’ ageist attitudes may engender negative perceptions of an elderly victim, which can affect the outcome of neglect cases. We discuss the potential for these findings to inform legal proceedings and protection of elderly individuals.","Ageism in the courtroom: mock juror perceptions of elder neglect The present study explored ageism in a civil court context.

"Riederer, Andrea M.;Golding, Jonathan M.",2020,social science,English,Perceptions of plea bargaining in cases of elder financial abuse,"The present study investigated perceptions of plea bargains in elder financial abuse. Approximately 78-90% of felony convictions are the result of plea bargains, yet very little work examines the public’s perceptions of it. Additionally, elders lose an estimated $2.6–36.5 billion dollars each year to financial abuse and exploitation. Participants were recruited from Mturk (N = 74) and completed a mixed-factors 2 (Amount of Money Stolen: $5,000 vs. $50,000) x 2 (Relationship of Victim and Perpetrator: son vs. caretaker) x 2 (Type of Sentence: reduced jail sentence vs. probation) x 2 (Participant Gender) design. Amount, relationship, and sentence were within-participant factors, while gender was between-participant. It was found that there were main effects of amount, sentence, and relationship between victim and defendant such that participants showed a preference for plea bargains when the amount in question was lower ($5,000 vs. $50,000), when the sentence given was harsher (a reduced jail sentence vs. probation), and when the defendant was the victim’s son (vs. a caretaker).","Perceptions of plea bargaining in cases of elder financial abuse The present study investigated perceptions of plea bargains in elder financial abuse.

"Chen, Mengtong;Chan, Ko Ling",2022,social science,English,"Elder abuse and neglect in China: Prevalence, co-occurrence, and intergenerational risk factors","The prevalence and patterns of elder abuse and neglect in China have been understudied. The objectives of this study were to examine the chronicity and prevalence of different patterns of elder abuse, and the influence of individual and contextual risk factors. We used data from a sample of 7,466 adults randomly recruited from six regions in China. The participants responded to a questionnaire about their demographic characteristics, childhood abuse experiences, and instances of abuse and neglect against their elderly parents. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association of elder abuse and neglect with individual and contextual factors. The results showed that one in 10 participants reported that their elderly parents had experienced abuse or neglect in the past year. The elder victims were reported to have suffered different types of abuse and neglect on multiple occasions, ranging from 3.6 to 11.82 times on average. More than 5% of participants reported that their elderly parents had suffered two or more types of abuse and neglect in the past year, accounting for 40% of the elderly victims. The co-occurrence of elder abuse within elderly couples was also high. Reports of abuse and neglect of elderly parents were related to low socioeconomic status, living in rural areas, and the experience of childhood abuse of the participants. This study supports the model of intergenerational transmission of violence in the Chinese population. The high prevalence, chronicity, and co-occurrence of elder abuse and neglect underline the importance of screening for risk factors, and have implications for preventive practice and policy.","Elder abuse and neglect in China: Prevalence, co-occurrence, and intergenerational risk factors The prevalence and patterns of elder abuse and neglect in China have been understudied.

This community-based participatory research study, which examined perceptions of mistreatment by family among 100 urban and rural older American Indians, permits a rare glimpse into how Native elders themselves understand this issue. Here, good treatment was conceptualized in terms of being taken care of, having one’s needs met, and being respected. We found relatively high standards for how elders should be treated—such as the belief that an elder’s needs should be anticipated and met without the elder needing to ask—in the face of widespread accounts of the mistreatment of elders within the community, largely through various acts of financial exploitation and neglect. Substance abuse and culture loss were blamed formuch of the elder mistreatment occurring in contemporary Native communities.","The conceptualization of mistreatment by older American Indians The problem of how to conceptualize elder mistreatment goes back several decades, and is especially important for ethnic minority populations, who may have perspectives that differ from the dominant society.

Grounded theory methodology was used. An online recruitment strategy was used to identify a sample of adult daughters (N = 13) who self-identified as having an abusive relationship with their aging mother. Data collection was completed through semi-structured telephone interviews. Daughters framed their relationship around their perceptions of past childhood injustices. These injustices invoked strong negative emotions. Daughters had equally strong motivations for sustaining the relationship, driven by desire to reconcile their negative experience through seeking validation and futile-hoping as well as a sense of obligation to do due diligence. Together these factors created an environment of inevitable confrontation and a relationship defined by chronic conflict. Findings from the study provide theoretical insights to the conceptualization of aggression, power relationships, and the development of elder abuse and neglect.","Adult daughters’ descriptions of their mother–daughter relationship in the context of chronic conflict The purpose of this article is to describe, from the perspective of the adult daughter, the mother–daughter relationship in the context of chronic conflict.

Viewed broadly, deficiencies in elder death investigations can lead to the underreporting of elder abuse and the reduction of legal options for victims, which may reflect a systemic pattern of social injustice.",improving medicolegal death investigative gaps fatal elder abuse purpose brief present case vignettes illustrate omissions investigation elder deaths vignettes demonstrate need standardized approach conduct medicolegal investigations fatal elder abuse described oversights recommendation offered address gap investigation processes turn improve determination cause manner elder death inherent limitations resources practical realities death investigation discussed recommendations future research viewed broadly deficiencies elder death investigations lead underreporting elder abuse reduction legal options victims reflect systemic pattern social injustice,improving medicolegal death investigative gaps fatal elder abuse purpose brief present case vignettes illustrate  investigation elder deaths vignettes demonstrate need standardized approach conduct medicolegal investigations fatal elder abuse described  recommendation offered address gap investigation processes turn improve determination cause manner elder death inherent limitations resources practical realities death investigation discussed recommendations future research viewed broadly deficiencies elder death investigations lead underreporting elder abuse reduction legal options victims reflect systemic pattern social ,improving medicolegal death    elder abuse purpose brief  case vignettes   investigation elder deaths vignettes  need    medicolegal investigations  elder abuse     address  investigation   improve    elder death   resources   death investigation  recommendations future research    elder death investigations lead underreporting elder abuse reduction legal  victims    social 
"Casey, Sharon M.;Katz, Ralph V.;Huang, Shulamite;Smith, Barbara J.",2020,medical,English,Geriatric Health Experts Validate Oral Neglect Timelines for the Institutionalized Elderly,"The purpose of this follow-up Delphi survey was to have an expert panel of 31 academic geriatric physicians, geriatric nurses, and medical directors of nursing homes evaluate the original timeline set to avoid oral neglect of nursing home residents. The Oral Neglect in Institutionalized Elderly (ONiIE) timelines defined oral neglect as having occurred when >7 days for acute oral diseases/conditions or >34 days for chronic oral disease/conditions had passed between initial diagnosis and offering access to dental care to the long-term care (LTC) nursing home resident. The results of this follow-up Delphi survey validated those originally defined ONiIE timelines as 90% of this panel agreed with the original timelines. This ONiIE definition adds a broad-based validation for the ONiIE timelines for setting an oral health standard of care for institutionalized elderly residents of nursing homes and should now be used to protect the vulnerable elderly residing in LTC nursing homes.","Geriatric Health Experts Validate Oral Neglect Timelines for the Institutionalized Elderly The purpose of this follow-up Delphi survey was to have an expert panel of 31 academic geriatric physicians, geriatric nurses, and medical directors of nursing homes evaluate the original timeline set to avoid oral neglect of nursing home residents.

"Moore, Steve",2018,social science,English,Oops! Its happened again! Evidence of the continuing abuse of older people in care homes,"The purpose of this paper is to present findings from an empirical research project designed to enhance knowledge of the current extent and nature of abuse in contemporary care homes for older people. A self-completion, postal questionnaire was used to elicit both numerical and textual data that was subsequently subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The questionnaire was distributed to newly appointed care staff in six participating care homes providing care to older people to determine the nature of any abuse they may have witnessed in the homes in which they had previously worked. A significant proportion of respondents described instances of predominantly psychological and physical abuse and neglect. Though the research draws upon the experiences of only 194 anonymous questionnaire respondents, of whom 140 had witnessed abuse; data suggest that abuse continues to occur in some care homes for older people. The research has revealed staffs’ recent experiences of a range of abusive acts and practices. Findings suggest that changes are required to current methods of external scrutiny and investigation of practices in care homes.","Oops! Its happened again!

"Carey, Catherine;Hodges, Jacob;Webb, John K.",2018,social science,English,Changes in state legislation and the impacts on elder financial fraud and exploitation,"The purpose of this paper is to summarize how state legislators are responding to the increasing incidence of elder financial fraud and exploitation (EFFE) and investigate the impact of new state legislation. Our empirical model investigates the impact of recent changes in state legislation, after controlling for relevant state demographics, on the prevalence of EFFE claims reported in the Consumer Sentinel Network database. We use panel data in a fixed effects model with and without time dummy variables. States with additional penalties targeting EFFE have a significantly lower percentage of complaints from elders, whereas the impact of mandatory and protected voluntary reporting laws is not significant in this sample. State legislators have increased their awareness of and are acting to produce legislation protecting the elderly from EFFE. Increased information, training and data sharing across states can go a long way to detecting and prosecuting EFFE cases.","Changes in state legislation and the impacts on elder financial fraud and exploitation The purpose of this paper is to summarize how state legislators are responding to the increasing incidence of elder financial fraud and exploitation (EFFE) and investigate the impact of new state legislation.

Nakrem,2020,medical,English,Nursing home leaders' perception of factors influencing the reporting of elder abuse and neglect: a qualitative study,"The purpose of this study is to explore the factors that influence the reporting of adverse events related to elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes from nursing home leaders' perspectives. Good leadership requires in-depth knowledge of the care and service provided and the ability to identify and address problems that can arise in clinical practice. A qualitative explorative design with data triangulation was used. The sample consisted of 43 participants from two levels of nursing home leadership, representing six municipalities and 21 nursing homes in Norway. Focus group interviews were undertaken with 28 ward leaders and individual interviews with 15 nursing home directors. The constant comparative method was used for the analyses. Both ward leaders and nursing home directors described formal and informal ways of obtaining information related to elder abuse and neglect. There were differences between their perceptions of the feasibility of obtaining formal reports about abuse in the nursing home. Three main categories of influencing factors emerged: (1) organisation structural factors, (2) cultural factors and (3) abuse severity factors. A main finding is that in its present form, the Norwegian adverse event reporting system is not designed to detect abuse and neglect. This paper provides an in-depth understanding of patient safety and factors related to reporting elder abuse in nursing homes in Norway.","Nursing home leaders' perception of factors influencing the reporting of elder abuse and neglect: a qualitative study The purpose of this study is to explore the factors that influence the reporting of adverse events related to elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes from nursing home leaders' perspectives.

We performed an ethnographic qualitative-descriptive study. Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare providers associated with three health centers located in areas with medium and high levels of poverty. A phenomenological approach was used to identify themes, subthemes and codes. Three main types of barriers were found: 1) institutional framework; 2) professional competency limitations and the dominance of a biomedical vision; and 3) the invisibilization of elder abuse. These barriers, described by healthcare workers, highlight the complexity involved in integrating the treatment of elder abuse into primary care health services. It is necessary to develop public educational and preventive public policies for elder abuse that are coordinated both with support services to treat such cases as well as with programs to strengthen healthcare providers professional competency.","Barriers to managing elder abuse in primary care services: Experiences of healthcare providers in Mexico City The purpose of this study was to analyze the barriers to managing elder abuse from the perspective of primary care health workers in Mexico City.

Triangulated interviews were conducted with 71 APS caseworkers, 55 victims of substantiated abuse whose cases they managed, and 35 third party persons. Pure financial exploitation (PFE) was characterized by victim unawareness of financial exploitation and living alone. Physical abuse (PA) was characterized by victim’s desire to protect the abusive individual. Neglect was characterized by isolation and victim’s residing with the abusive individual. Hybrid financial exploitation (HFE) was characterized by mutual dependency. These differences indicate the need for tailoring interventions to increase victim safety. PFE requires victims to maintain financial security and independence. PA requires services to meet the needs of abusive individuals. Neglect requires greater monitoring when elderly persons reside with another person. HFE requires the provision of services to both members of the dyad.","How case characteristics differ across four types of elder maltreatment: Implications for tailoring interventions to increase victim safety The purpose of this study was to determine whether case characteristics are differentially associated with four forms of elder maltreatment.

The authors performed a retrospective medical record review of neuropsychological and demographic data gathered during decisional capacity assessments. Squalor dwelling was defined by unsanitary living conditions that posed a danger to the occupant’s health or safety. Mean neuropsychological test scores were compared between squalor-dwelling (n = 50) and non–squalor-dwelling (n = 180) subjects. Squalor-dwelling clients were significantly younger than non–squalor-dwelling clients. There were no distribution differences among gender, education, race, or rural-dwelling status. Although both groups performed poorly on each neuropsychological measure, squalor dwellers demonstrated better memory and general cognitive performance. Cognition, depression, gender, race, education, dementia diagnosis, and rural-dwelling status seem insufficient to explain squalor-dwelling behaviors.

Responses were analyzed using an open coding process. Most professionals were not aware that IPV against older women was a problem in their communities, although were willing to offer support if asked. Support for older victims was provided within the purview of each profession. Referrals to other support services were made, although collaboration did not occur unless a health-related emergency arose in which professionals were mandated to work together. Findings provide the groundwork for further research on the education and training of community professionals on IPV in late life and the development of more integrated community-based service protocols to address this hidden, but widespread concern.","Community professionals’ response to intimate partner violence against rural older women The purpose of this study was to examine rural community professionals’ awareness, perceptions, and experience with intimate partner violence (IPV) in late life.

A Phenomenological qualitative approach was adopted. Employing criterion purposive sampling, 12 older adults were recruited from a community in Winneba in Ghana. A semi-structured interview guide following focus group discussion was used to explore the challenges and the coping strategies of older adults. Thematic data analysis making use of descriptive coding was employed. The study revealed that neglected older adults experience financial challenges, health issues, and social isolations. They lacked decent accommodation, nutritional food and were prevented from determining the kind of food they want to eat. These neglected older adults survived by adopting internal and external coping strategies. This study offers a better understanding of the needs of neglected older adults and the nature of their coping strategies.

A Phenomenological qualitative approach was adopted. Employing criterion purposive sampling, 12 older adults were recruited from a community in Winneba in Ghana. A semi-structured interview guide following focus group discussion was used to explore the challenges and the coping strategies of older adults. Thematic data analysis making use of descriptive coding was employed. The study revealed that neglected older adults experience financial challenges, health issues, and social isolations. They lacked decent accommodation, nutritional food and were prevented from determining the kind of food they want to eat. These neglected older adults survived by adopting internal and external coping strategies. This study offers a better understanding of the needs of neglected older adults and the nature of their coping strategies.

J. P. Haltom; E. Card; N. Wells; D. E. Lowen,2019,health/care,English,The hands that cradle: A pilot study of parent adverse childhood experience scores,"The purpose of this study was to gather population-specific data within a pediatric hospital and contribute to understanding the intergenerational continuity of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). This descriptive study aimed at measuring the ACE scores of parents or caretakers whose child was a suspected victim of abuse or neglect. The “Finding Your ACE Score questionnaire was used to determine participants' scores.” Fifteen participants enrolled in the study (N = 15), and 86.7% had exposure to ACEs. Statistical significance was found when comparing ACE scores with reported income levels (p = .051). This study supports previous findings of ACEs being present in a variety of populations, and it presents practice implications for advance practice registered nurses (APRNs) in various practice settings. Findings support that research regarding how to assess and treat ACEs throughout family members is both necessary and difficult. Additional data regarding the intergenerational continuity of ACEs might influence how APRNs deliver family-specific assessment, treatment, and prevention of ACEs throughout generations of family members.","The hands that cradle: A pilot study of parent adverse childhood experience scores The purpose of this study was to gather population-specific data within a pediatric hospital and contribute to understanding the intergenerational continuity of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

"Pickering, Carolyn E. Z.;Yefimova, Maria;Maxwell, Christopher;Puga, Frank;Sullivan, Tami",2020,health/care,English,Daily Context for Abusive and Neglectful Behavior in Family Caregiving for Dementia,"The purpose of this study was to identify risk and protective factors for abusive and neglectful behavior in the context of daily caregiving. Family caregivers who co-reside with a care recipient with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, recruited from social media, completed 21-days of diaries. Multilevel modeling with days (n = 831) nested within caregivers (N = 50) was used to evaluate relationships between hypothesized risk and protective factors and the odds of an abusive or neglectful behavior on a given day. Disruptions in the daily routine and stress of the caregiver related to behavioral symptoms of the care recipient are significant risk factors for abusive and neglectful behavior. Participating in a meaningful activity with the care recipient when it occurs twice in a day is a significant protective factor against use of a neglect behavior (OR = 0.19; CI 0.06–0.64; p = .01), but not for abusive behavior. Hypotheses that spending the full day together would increase risk, and that receipt of instrumental support and caregiver participation in self-care would decrease risk, were not supported. Findings demonstrate that risk of an abusive or neglectful behavior varies from day-to-day in the presence and absence of contextual factors, and that the majority of the variance in the odds an abusive or neglectful behavior occurring is related to day-level factors. Findings demonstrate that diary surveys are critical to identifying ecologically valid modifiable risk and protective factors for abusive and neglectful behaviors that can be targeted in future interventions.","Daily Context for Abusive and Neglectful Behavior in Family Caregiving for Dementia The purpose of this study was to identify risk and protective factors for abusive and neglectful behavior in the context of daily caregiving.

As aged care in many countries is predominantly publicly funded, it is important to understand the general public's attitudes towards aged care quality, what aspects of care quality they think are most important and their willingness to contribute to increased funding to the sector. This paper asks specifically whether self-reported aged care literacy impacts expectations and willingness to pay. More than 10,000 members of the general population were surveyed stratified by age, gender and state. Regardless of the level of aged care literacy, there was consensus about what constitutes quality care, and care priorities for the sector. However, aged care literacy affected willingness to pay to fund a better-quality aged care system. The current crisis facing Australia's aged care system and that of many other countries internationally demonstrates the central importance of general public support to drive quality improvements, recognising that increasing public expenditure on aged care is a necessary part of the solution.

"Fan, Jessie X.;Yu, Zhou",2021,social science,English,Understanding aging and consumer fraud victimization in the Chinese context: A two-stage conceptual approach,"The relationship between aging and consumer fraud victimization is mixed in the literature. Most studies based on survey data have found older consumers less likely to be fraud victims, while a few studies have found older consumers more likely to be victimized, especially with certain fraud types. We developed a two-stage conceptual framework to differentiate fraud exposure from fraud victimization once exposed. Using nationally representative Chinese data and controlling for confounders, we found that consumers between 65 and 74 face similar risks of being targeted by perpetrators compared to younger groups, while consumers 75+ and older are less likely to be exposed to fraud. However, once exposed, both groups of older consumers are significantly more likely to become fraud victims. In the Chinese context, these two opposing effects led to an overall higher risk of consumer financial fraud victimization by older consumers.","Understanding aging and consumer fraud victimization in the Chinese context: A two-stage conceptual approach The relationship between aging and consumer fraud victimization is mixed in the literature.

This evaluation study aimed to assess the benefits and challenges of a pilot scheme in Aotearoa New Zealand employing restorative processes to respond to elder harm and to discuss implications for future practice. Thirty interviews were conducted with professionals, older persons and family members. Our findings show that restorative encounters, in particular circle processes, provided a safe environment to engage honestly with each other and for mutual understanding and trust to emerge. The collaborative relationship of key stakeholders was a notable strength of the pilot.

"Quinn, Mary Joy;Nerenberg, Lisa;Navarro, Adria E.;Wilber, Kathleen H.",2017,law,English,Developing an undue influence screening tool for adult protective services,"The study purpose was to develop and pilot an undue influence screening tool for California’s Adult Protective Services (APS) personnel based on the definition of undue influence enacted into California law January 1, 2014. Methods included four focus groups with APS providers (n = 33), piloting the preliminary tool by APS personnel (n = 15), and interviews with four elder abuse experts and two APS administrators. Social service literature—including existing undue influence models—was reviewed, as were existing screening and assessment tools. Using the information from these various sources, the California Undue Influence Screening Tool (CUIST) was developed.

Methods included four focus groups with APS providers (n = 33), piloting the preliminary tool by APS personnel (n = 15), and interviews with four elder abuse experts and two APS administrators. Social service literature—including existing undue influence models—was reviewed, as were existing screening and assessment tools. Using the information from these various sources, the California Undue Influence Screening Tool (CUIST) was developed.

However, research on these thefts in long-term care homes has yet to be published. This exploratory study makes first steps toward bridging this gap. Using 107 Minnesota Department of Health’s investigation reports substantiated as “drug diversion” between 2013 and 2021 in assisted living residences and nursing homes, we found that 11,328.5 tablets were stolen from 368 residents (97.5% were controlled substances), with over 30 tablets stolen per resident. We also identified the types of medications stolen, duration of theft, extent to which nurses stole the medications or were those initially suspecting thefts, and the role of surveillance cameras in confirming allegations. The findings could raise awareness to this form of elder mistreatment in long-term care homes and call for action to address it.","Theft of Controlled Substances in Long-Term Care Homes: An Exploratory Study The theft of controlled substances has been studied in the community and healthcare settings including hospitals, pharmacies, hospice, and pain clinics.

There are considerable deficiencies in the present knowledge of how to conduct well-functioning health care for immigrants with dementia symptoms. The aim of this study was to explore caring and uncaring encounters between assistant nurses and immigrants in two group homes for persons with dementia symptoms in Sweden: a Finnish-speaking as well as a Swedish-speaking context. In addition, this study aims to describe how caring and uncaring encounters are manifested in these two contexts according to Halldórsdóttir’s theory of “Caring and Uncaring encounters”. Method: Descriptive field notes from 30 separate observations were analyzed using qualitative deductive content analysis. The main category “caring encounters” focused on reaching out to initiate connection through communication, removing masks of anonymity by acknowledging the unique person, acknowledgment of connection by being personal. Reaching a level of truthfulness by being present and showing respect, raising the level of solidarity by equality and true negotiation of care, based on the residents’ needs. The main category, uncaring encounters, focused on disinterest in and insensitivity towards the other, coldness in the connection and lack of humanity in care situations. The observations showed that caring encounters occurred more in the Finnish-speaking context and uncaring encounters more often in the Swedish context. Encounters could be caring, uncaring, and carried out using a person-centered approach. Communication and relationships could be facilitated using the same language but also through learning to interpret residents’ needs and desires.","Caring and Uncaring Encounters between Assistant Nurses and Immigrants with Dementia Symptoms in Two Group Homes in Sweden-an Observational Study The total number of people with dementia symptoms is expected to double every 20 years and there will also be an increase in the number of older immigrants in several countries.

However, data on the forensic scenario is still lacking. In this context, the aim of the present work was to provide a comprehensive literature review of this inherently complex phenomenon in the post-mortem setting, in order to better characterize it from a forensic point of view. A comprehensive literature search was performed in three electronic databases following the PRISMA guidelines. Sociodemographic and medical data of victims and perpetrators, post-mortem data, types of abuse and risk factors were extracted from non-aggregated data. Forty-eight papers dealing with abuse in the post-mortem setting were included, with a predominance of case reports and case series. The review showed that neglect was the most common type of abuse and victims are predominantly older women who are abused in a domestic setting by trusted family member. To generate more and better data, expanded research in the forensic field requires standardized methods and the raise of professional awareness about abuse of older people.","On tackling abuse of older people: The forensic challenges in fatal cases investigation The World Health Organization recently presented the priorities for tackling abuse of older people in a coordinated and strategic way.

"Elsherbiny, Mohamed Mohamed K.;Al Maamari, Raya H.",2018,social science,English,The effectiveness of Logotherapy in mitigating the social isolation of neglected institutionalised older people,"There are various types of elder abuse; one of the most prevalent and most harmful abuses is neglect. Social isolation is one of the most common consequences of neglect, with an inability to find meaning in life closely associated with both these issues. One intervention that might be used with older people suffering from neglect and social isolation is Logotherapy—a meaning-based intervention. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of Logotherapy in mitigating the social isolation of older people suffering from neglect. This study was developed using a quantitative research design, and with a purposive sample of forty-three socially isolated older individuals in a single institution for the elderly in Cairo, Egypt. The study follows a quasi-experimental study model. A social disconnectedness scale and a perceived isolation scale were used to assess both degrees of social isolation. The intervention lasted for twelve weeks, with two weeks of follow-up work. A significant difference emerged between the intervention and control groups. The results indicate that enabling older people to experience meaning in life by emphasising the value of social relationships and interactions has a positive effect on their social networks.","The effectiveness of Logotherapy in mitigating the social isolation of neglected institutionalised older people There are various types of elder abuse; one of the most prevalent and most harmful abuses is neglect.

The Researching Interventions to Promote Ethics in social care project responded to the question: Which is the most effective ethics education intervention for care-givers in residential social care? A pragmatic cluster trial explored the impact of three ethics education interventions for: (a) interactive face-to-face ethics teaching; (b) reflective ethics discussion groups; and (c) an immersive simulation experience. There was also a control arm (d). 144 trial participants were recruited from 39 residential care homes for older people in southern England. Change scores compared across intervention arms showed a significant reduction in work-related moral stress in the teaching arm compared with control group (p = .03); there were no significant differences between control and intervention arms in change scores for moral sensitivity, interpersonal reactivity (empathy) or ethical leadership. Qualitative data themes were as follows: ethical care; care challenges; and ethical care inhibitors. Overall findings stimulate reflection on the value of three different ethics education interventions and the most appropriate means to evaluate their impact. Findings suggest the complexity and diverse nature of ethical competence in care.

The article discusses the ways in which dementia care practitioners may be able to make the most of existing data.",abuse neglect mistreatment older people dementia care homes hospitals england potential secondary data analysis innovative practice concern people dementia particular risk elder abuse little data confirm fears paper presents findings updated investigation secondary sources data abuse older people dementia england conducted 2013 sources data poor care abuse neglect people dementia care home hospital settings collected different purposes hard link article discusses ways dementia care practitioners able existing data,abuse neglect mistreatment older people dementia care homes hospitals england potential secondary data analysis innovative practice concern people dementia particular risk elder abuse little data confirm  paper presents findings updated investigation secondary sources data abuse older people dementia england conducted 2013 sources data poor care abuse neglect people dementia care home hospital settings collected different purposes hard link article discusses ways dementia care practitioners able existing data,abuse neglect mistreatment older people dementia care homes hospitals england   data analysis  practice  people dementia particular risk elder abuse  data   paper presents findings updated investigation   data abuse older people dementia england conducted 2013  data  care abuse neglect people dementia care home hospital settings collected    link article  ways dementia care practitioners   data
"Belveg, Stephanie",2023,social science,English,Staff burnout and the neglect of elderly residential care patients,"There is increasing concern about patient neglect in nursing homes as nursing home staff become burnt out. Although there has been research on burnout in nursing home staff and neglect, little research has been done to understand the specific connection of burnout and neglect through the lived experiences of staff members. Underpinned by Maslach’s theory of burnout, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the lived experiences of nursing home staff who experienced burnout before and after they witnessed neglect of elderly patients. Nine semistructured interviews were conducted with elderly care staff who had experienced burnout and witnessed burnout and neglect in their work. Participants included eight females and one male. Through thematic analysis, four themes emerged: lack of staff support, well-being of residents, compassion for working with elderly and unintentional actions. These findings show that nursing home staff felt burnout was linked to not having enough staff, and that can lead to neglect. Neglect was found to be unintentional. This study shows that many people working in the field of elderly care want to be in the field to help but they become burnt out and then do not want to do the job. These findings can impact positive social change and aid to the ever-growing field of elder care by understanding what can lead to burnout and how burnout can lead to unintentional neglect. This research can help elder care agencies and their staff understand burnout experienced and the neglect taking place and use this understanding to determine what can be done to mitigate these problems.","Staff burnout and the neglect of elderly residential care patients There is increasing concern about patient neglect in nursing homes as nursing home staff become burnt out.

Data from 896 respondents (60 years old and over) were collected in April 2009. Principal component analysis was used to construct a wealth index, and logistic regressions were performed to test the associations between wealth and elder abuse. Results reveal that about 62% of individuals from poor households face abuse of some kind, whereas only 6% of individuals from rich households do. The test of the relationship between elder abuse and wealth also suggests that individuals from rich households were more likely not to be abused than individuals from poor households.

We wanted to identify details related to psychological and emotional abuse in the older population in our region and to determine the importance of the Elderly Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI©) in comprehensive geriatric assessments. This cross-sectional study conducted between March 2015 and May 2016 included 386 consecutive hospitalised patients over 65 years of age. All patients underwent a geriatric assessment, data were collected about their medical history, and the EASI© was administered to each. The main outcome was identifying the presence, the type of abuse and the factors associated with abuse. There were 21.5% of patients who suffered any form of abuse. Women were more frequently abused than men. Emotional abuse was the most common (60.2%) followed by neglect (53%) and physical abuse (22.91%); sexual abuse was absent in our study group. The abused patients had an impaired cognitive function (P = 0.034). They were also malnourished (P ≤ 0.001) and depressed (P = 0.001). The presence of peripheral artery disease, stroke, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease, musculoskeletal diseases and anxiety correlated with the presence of abuse. No statistically significant correlation was found between the degree of independence in instrumental activities of daily living and the presence of abuse (r = 0.105, P = 0.051). EASI is a tool for detecting elder abuse and should be included in the standard geriatric assessment to prevent ageism.

All observational studies investigating elder abuse as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, mortality, and health-care utilization were included. Of 517 articles initially captured, 19 articles met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Two reviewers independently performed abstract screening, full-texts appraisal, and quality assessment using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Across 19 studies, methodological heterogeneity was a prominent feature; seven definitions of EAN and nine measurement tools for abuse were employed. Summary of results reveals a wide range of EAN outcomes, from premature mortality to increased health-care consumption and various forms of physical and psychological symptoms. Higher risks of mortality emerged as the most credible outcome, while the majority of morbidity outcomes originated from cross-sectional studies. Our findings suggest that there is an underrepresentation of older adults from non-Western populations and developing countries, and there is a need for more population-based prospective studies in middle- and low-income regions.

Mason,2022,social science,English,"Child Maltreatment, Youth Violence, Intimate Partner Violence, and Elder Mistreatment: A Review and Theoretical Analysis of Research on Violence Across the Life Course","This article reports the results of a scoping review of the literature on life-course patterns of violence that span the developmental periods of childhood, adolescence, and early and middle adulthood. We also assess the evidence on elder mistreatment and its relation to earlier forms of violence. Additionally, we draw on theories and empirical studies to help explain the transmission of violence over time and relational contexts and the factors that appear to mitigate risks and promote resilience in individuals exposed to violence. Results suggest that encounters with violence beginning in childhood elevate the risk for violence in subsequent developmental periods. The strongest connections are between child maltreatment (physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect) and violence in adolescence and between violence in adolescence and violence in early and middle adulthood. Persistence of violence into older adulthood leading to elder mistreatment is less well-documented, but probable, based on available research. We conclude that more attention should be paid to studying developmental patterns and intersecting forms of violence that extend into old age. To eradicate violence in all its forms, considerably more must be done to increase awareness of the repetition of violence; to connect research to actionable steps for prevention and intervention across the life course; and to better integrate systems that serve vulnerable children, youth, and adults. Primary prevention is essential to breaking the cycle of violence within families and to alleviating the risks to children caused by poverty and other external factors such as social disconnection within communities.","Child Maltreatment, Youth Violence, Intimate Partner Violence, and Elder Mistreatment: A Review and Theoretical Analysis of Research on Violence Across the Life Course This article reports the results of a scoping review of the literature on life-course patterns of violence that span the developmental periods of childhood, adolescence, and early and middle adulthood.

The first axis consists of three phenomenological dimensions: suffering, a “ticking clock,” and life wisdom. The second axis consists of four themes that emerged from the content analysis: loneliness, regret, being in a state of waiting, and being a living monument to perpetual victimhood. The practical implications of these phenomenological findings are then discussed.","Aging in the shadow of violence: A phenomenological conceptual framework for understanding elderly women who experienced lifelong IPV This article suggests a heuristic framework for understanding elderly women’s “lived experience” of lifelong intimate partner violence (IPV).

Constant comparative analysis was used to analyze data from in-depth telephone interviews with CNAs (N = 22) who experienced bullying while employed in a nursing home. The result of the analysis is a multistep model describing CNA perceptions of how, over time, they recognized and responded to the “toxic” work environment. The strategies used in responding to the “toxic” environment affected their care provision and were attributed to the development of several resident and worker safety outcomes. The data suggest that the etiology of abuse and neglect in nursing homes may be better explained by institutional cultures rather than individual traits of CNAs. Findings highlight the relationship between worker and patient safety, and suggest worker safety outcomes may be an indicator of quality in nursing homes.","Recognizing and Responding to the “Toxic” Work Environment: Worker Safety, Patient Safety, and Abuse/Neglect in Nursing Homes This grounded theory study examined how the certified nursing assistant (CNA) understands and responds to bullying in the workplace.

Alejandro,2022,social science,English,Chronic disease and elder mistreatment: A meta-analysis,"This meta-analysis investigated the relationships between chronic diseases and different forms of elder mistreatment (physical, emotional, sexual, financial, neglect, or overall abuse). Twelve different chronic disease risk markers linked to elder mistreatment were gathered from 48 studies (yielding 178 effect sizes (ESs) and a combined sample size of n = 390,785), then organized in to four broad chronic disease categories: endocrine disease, heart disease, neurological disease, and other chronic diseases. Data were analyzed with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software using a random effects approach. Neurological disease (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51), endocrine disease (OR = 1.38), heart disease (OR = 1.17), and other chronic diseases (OR = 1.26) were all significantly associated with elder mistreatments. Neurological disease (OR = 1.51) was found to have a significantly stronger association with elder mistreatment when compared to the heart disease category (OR = 1.17) and the other chronic disease category (OR = 1.26). When specifically investigating emotional abuse, there was a significantly stronger link with neurological disease (OR = 1.48) compared to other chronic diseases (OR = 1.21). This study provides the first meta-analytic benchmarks for understanding the links between chronic disease risk markers and different forms of elder mistreatment.","Chronic disease and elder mistreatment: A meta-analysis This meta-analysis investigated the relationships between chronic diseases and different forms of elder mistreatment (physical, emotional, sexual, financial, neglect, or overall abuse).

The study took a cross-sectional descriptive and analytical design. Using a sample of 285 respondents, data were obtained from 201 usable questionnaires collected from caregivers and officials relating with older persons in this area making it a response rate of 70.5%. Using statistical program for social scientists (SPSS), the researchers tested and analyzed six hypotheses. Results indicate that physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse and neglect negatively and significantly predicted welfare status. Though negatively related, social abuse and sexual abuse did not significantly predict welfare status. Family members and caregivers must make practices that do not promote physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse and neglect as these negatively affect the welfare status of elderly persons. District officials such as community development officers and other persons handling older persons need to implement policies that promote the welfare status of the elderly. The study demonstrates that the existence of physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse and neglect is a deterrent to older person’s welfare status.","Examining the effect of elder abuse on welfare status: the case of selected districts in Southwestern Uganda This paper aims to examine the predictive potential of elder abuse on welfare status of older persons in selected districts in Southwestern Uganda.

"Stevens, Emma;Price, Liz;Walker, Liz",2022,social science,English,"“Just because people are old, just because they're ill…” dignity matters in district nursing","This paper aims to explore the concept and practice, of dignity as understood and experienced by older adults and district nursing staff. The paper adds a new, nuanced, understanding of safeguarding possibilities in the context of district nursing care delivered in the home. The research used an ethnographic methodology involving observations of care between community district nursing clinicians and patients (n = 62) and semi-structured interviews with nursing staff (n = 11) and older adult recipients of district nursing care (n = 11) in England. Abuse is less likely to occur when clinicians are maintaining the dignity of their patients. The themes of time and space are used to demonstrate some fundamental ways in which dignity manifests. The absence of dignity offers opportunities for abuse and neglect to thrive; therefore, both time and space are essential safeguarding considerations. Dignity is influenced by time and how it is experienced temporally, but nurses are not allocated time to “do dignity”, an arguably essential component of the caregiving role, yet one that can become marginalised. The home-clinic exists as a clinical space requiring careful management to ensure it is also an environment of dignity that can safeguard older adults. District nurses have both a proactive and reactive role in ensuring their patients remain safeguarded. By ensuring care is delivered with dignity and taking appropriate action if they suspect abuse or neglect, district nurses can safeguard their patients. This paper begins to address an omission in existing empirical research regarding the role of district nursing teams in delivering dignified care and how this can safeguard older adults.","“Just because people are old, just because they're ill…” dignity matters in district nursing This paper aims to explore the concept and practice, of dignity as understood and experienced by older adults and district nursing staff.

F. Arthur-Holmes; R. M. Gyasi,2021,social science,English,COVID-19 crisis and increased risks of elder abuse in caregiving spaces,"This paper discusses the potential abuse and mistreatment against older adults by informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic has distorted many informal caregivers’ roles, which require serious adjustment for reducing caregiving stress and burden. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has created challenging situations in caregiving spaces, which have the tendency to cause informal caregivers to abuse older adults. However, research on elder abuse and mistreatment, up to this point, remains underexplored in Africa. We, therefore, call for a deeper research and interrogation on the pathways and dynamics of violence and abuse against older adults in Africa. We also raise awareness of increased risks of domestic elder abuse and neglect during COVID-19 to stimulate the interest of social welfare institutions in understanding this phenomenon and its prevalence in Africa. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic should serve as an avenue for governments, social welfare institutions, public health authorities, civil society and traditional leaders in African countries to develop a comprehensive programme and create public awareness to protect older adults against abuse, violence and neglect. The practical ways of minimising the effect of COVID-19 on domestic elder abuse in African settings are further discussed.","COVID-19 crisis and increased risks of elder abuse in caregiving spaces This paper discusses the potential abuse and mistreatment against older adults by informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.

In-depth interviews were conducted with social workers (n = 37) and service-user representatives (n = 11) from three English local authorities. Professional interviews focused on current practices in dealing with such cases. Service-user representatives were asked to discuss a fictitious obstructive case and potential actions that could be taken by social workers. Participants described current practice in terms of options for negotiation with third parties obstructing access to older people, ranging from ‘softer’ styles aiming to develop rapport to ‘more assertive’ approaches. Making good decisions about case allocation, being creative in pursuing cases and fostering good multi-agency relationships were valued by practitioners. Some service-user representatives questioned the time and resources involved in managing these cases. Policy makers may wish to consider developing guidelines for multi-agency partners outlining their responsibilities in such cases; practitioners may wish to consider whether offering an obstructer the services of an independent advocate would be useful.","Gaining access to possibly abused or neglected adults in England: Practice perspectives from social workers and service-user representatives This paper reports on a study that examined social workers’ and service-user representatives’ perspectives on current options for accessing older people living at home when entry is being obstructed by a third party, there are concerns about possible abuse or neglect and legal approaches are not considered appropriate.

"Mohd Mydin, Fadzilah Hanum;Othman, Sajaratulnisah",2020,medical,English,Elder abuse and neglect intervention in the clinical setting: Perceptions and barriers faced by primary care physicians in Malaysia,"This qualitative study attempts to explore the definition, perceptions, practice experience, and barriers of primary care physicians (PCPs) in identifying and intervening in cases of elder abuse and neglect at the primary care level. Semistructured in-depth interview was conducted among 10 PCPs. Participants were selected by purposive sampling. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. In general, PCPs showed consistency in defining elder abuse and neglect. PCPs considered that they were optimally positioned to intervene in cases of elder abuse and neglect, but indicated the potential of overlooking such problems. The hurdles faced by PCPs in the identification and intervention of elder abuse were determined to be occurring at three levels: clinical, organizational, and policy. At the clinical level, PCPs recognize that they are lacking both the confidence and knowledge of elder abuse and neglect intervention. PCPs’ conflicting personal and professional beliefs create barriers during the clinical practice. Time constraints, patients’ other clinical problems, and, in addition, the preservation of a good doctor–patient relationship overshadow the importance of addressing and intervening in elder abuse and neglect issues during the consultation. This is further exacerbated by the barriers perceived by the patients: their nondisclosure and reluctance to accept outside intervention. At the organizational level, the lack of efficient interagency networks or support for the health system poses barriers. At the policy level, the absence of legislation specifically addressing elder abuse also creates considerable difficulties. However, PCPs gave differing responses when asked about a law concerning the elderly and mandatory reporting. Addressing these multilevel barriers is critical for ensuring that opportunities arising at the primary care level for elder maltreatment intervention are correctly utilized.","Elder abuse and neglect intervention in the clinical setting: Perceptions and barriers faced by primary care physicians in Malaysia This qualitative study attempts to explore the definition, perceptions, practice experience, and barriers of primary care physicians (PCPs) in identifying and intervening in cases of elder abuse and neglect at the primary care level.

"Dong, XinQi",2015,social science,English,Elder abuse in Chinese populations: A global review,"This review focuses on the epidemiology of elder abuse in the global Chinese population with respect to its prevalence, risk factors, and consequences, as well as the perceptions of elder abuse. Evidence revealed that elder abuse and its subtypes are common among the global Chinese population with prevalence ranging from 0.2% to 64%. Younger age, lower income levels, depression, cognitive impairment, and lack of social support were consistently associated with self-reported elder abuse. Caregiver burden was a constant risk factor for the proclivity to elder abuse by caregivers. The adverse health outcomes of elder abuse included suicidal ideation and psychological stress. Some primary research gaps exist: such as, lack of consistency in measurements and recall periods, insufficient studies on the causal relationships between potential risk factors and elder abuse, consequences of elder abuse, and possible interventions. In order to reduce the risk of elder abuse in the global Chinese population, collaboration is encouraged among researchers, health care professionals, social service providers, and policy makers.","Elder abuse in Chinese populations: A global review This review focuses on the epidemiology of elder abuse in the global Chinese population with respect to its prevalence, risk factors, and consequences, as well as the perceptions of elder abuse.

The prevalence of elder abuse reported during the ED visit was lower than reported in the community. The most commonly detected type of elder abuse was neglect, and then physical abuse. The following factors were more common in identified cases of elder abuse: female sex, cognitive impairment, functional disability, frailty, social isolation, and lower socioeconomic status. Psychiatric and substance use disorders were more common among victims and their caregivers. Screening tools have been proposed, but multicenter validation and influence of screening on patient-important outcomes were lacking.

Analysis was conducted on a subsample of 150 women aged 60+ from GBV-Information Management System intake data of 12,480 GBV survivors. Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare differences in GBV incidents among women who experienced DV compared to other types of GBV. Using United Nations humanitarian and aging frameworks, qualitative analysis was completed following two rounds of coding. Sixty percent of women aged ≥60 experienced DV. Local women were more likely to experience DV versus displaced women (85.6% vs. 48.3%, p < .001). Six core themes emerged: experiencing versus witnessing violence, intergenerational conflict, livelihoods, alcohol, humiliation, and neglect. Deeper understanding of DV among older women in humanitarian settings is needed, strengthening a call to action to prioritize protection against, and prevention of, GBV more broadly among this marginalized group.","Understanding Domestic Violence Among Older Women in Ukraine: A Secondary Analysis Using Gender-Based Violence Screening Data This secondary descriptive analysis sought to understand Gender-Based Violence (GBV), with a focus on Domestic Violence (DV), among older women in Ukraine’s conflict setting.

Qualitative research was conducted, using in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 15 Arab Israeli older women. Underlying this study is a feminist perspective and a life course perspective. Two main themes emerged: (1) socially endorsed violence against Arab Israeli women. This took several forms: men’s dominant position and women’s dependence, sources of violence used against women before and after marriage, and the social education of women to accept their fate. (2) The construction of a multifaceted survival identity throughout Arab Israeli women’s life and old age. This identity has a variety of dimensions, including: a submissive victim identity, a rehabilitative identity of respect in old age, and a form of split identity that combines both the rehabilitative social identity and the marginal identity still experienced within the home.","From a humble identity to an identity of respect: Lifetime abuse among Arab Israeli older women This study addresses the retrospective experiences of older Arab Israeli women after a lifetime of living in the shadow of intimate partner violence.

A cross-sectional study was carried out including 677 older adults (≥60 years) during 2017. Results show that overall, 23.9% of older people reported being a victim of abuse in the last 12 months. The prevalence of psychological abuse was 19.9%, financial abuse 5.8%, physical abuse 2.5% and sexual abuse 1.9%. Older people who report abuse were more likely to have perceived insufficient income and low social support. The abuse was also significantly associated with poor health status and depressive symptoms. Even in an auspicious period, more than a fifth of older people experiences abuse which is associated with social and health vulnerabilities. These results support that an investment should be made in terms of policies toward an age-friendly environment.","Abuse among Portuguese older people at a time of economic crisis recovery: Findings from the harmed study This study aimed to assess the prevalence of abuse against Portuguese older people after an economic crisis and to assess how it has influenced health.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with EN. We included demographic factors, chronic diseases, cognitive function, and daily activity function in our comprehensive analysis and showed that they had different effects on the six EN dimensions. Different demographic factors such as gender, age, marriage, education, occupation, residence, and household income were included in the comprehensive analysis, and the results showed that these factors had different effects on the six dimensions of EN. Next, we found that older adults with chronic diseases are prone to life neglect, medical neglect, and residential environment neglect. Older adults with better cognitive abilities were less likely to be neglected, and a decline in daily activity capacity has been linked to EN in older adults. Future studies are needed to identify the health effects of these associated factors, develop prevention strategies for EN, and improve the quality of life of older adults living in communities.","Prevalence and correlates of elder neglect in the community-dwelling Chinese population: New evidence from the CLHLS study This study aimed to explore the prevalence of elder neglect (EN) and its associated factors among community-based Chinese older adults.We used data from the 2018 phase of a nationwide cross-sectional study, the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), which recruited 15,854 older adults to complete the study interviews that incorporated six dimensions of EN, namely, life neglect, social isolation, medical neglect, poor living situation, family neglect, and social neglect.

Our cross-sectional study was conducted with 161 FPs in Kütahya, a city in Türkiye. A questionnaire including demographic characteristics, the frequency with which Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI) questions were asked and knowledge level of EAN was applied to the FPs. Only about a quarter (24.2%) of the FPs felt competent regarding EAN. The rate of participants who had encountered EAN victims before was 46%. Of these, 40% reported psychological violence, 24.3% reported physical and psychological violence and 21.6% reported only physical violence. FPs also reported that inconsistency in anamnesis (87.0%), inconsistency between anamnesis and physical examination findings (85.1%) and frequent visits to the emergency department (59.6%) raised suspicion about EAN. It was also observed that 68.9% of the FPs knew that healthcare professionals had a legal obligation to report elder abuse. Only 23.0% of the FPs who encountered cases of violence and abuse stated that they had made a legal report. Among the FPs who did not report, 40.4% stated that they did not report because they had some reservations or did not know how to do so (35.1%). Due to a lack of knowledge and some concerns, the rate of reporting EAN to judicial authorities was also low. FPs were not aware of the importance of EAN in terms of elderly health.","Family physicians' knowledge levels about elder abuse and neglect in a province of Türkiye and hesitations in reporting This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and reservations of family physicians (FPs) in reporting elderly abuse and neglect (EAN).

The sample of the study is composed of 465 elderly women and men (60+ years of age) who live in different cities in Turkey. First, validity and reliability analyses of the H-S “East” are carried out. Subsequently, binary logistic regression analysis is performed to determine the factors that affect elder abuse. In this study, the H-S “East” has a three-factor construction as found in the original scale. Inner consistency coefficient is found as .814. Elder abuse is mostly affected by “life satisfaction,” “use of social benefits,” “satisfaction with income,” and “age.” The results show that the Turkish version may be used as a valid and reliable tool in determining elderly abuse in social work practice and also for the purpose of early diagnosis and in other relevant research. Moreover, when the factors that affect elder abuse are taken into account, care and support facilities for the social inclusion of elderly should be developed and relevant social policies should be revised.","Screening for Elder Abuse Among Turkish Older People: Validity of the Hwalek–Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test (H-S “East”) This study aims to adapt “The Hwalek–Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test (H-S “East”)” (Neale, Hwalek, Scott, Sengstock, & Stahl, 1991) to Turkish and to assess its validity and reliability while determining the factors that affect elder abuse.

"Dey, Debashrita;Tripathi, Priyanka",2024,social science,English,Compromised well-being: Implications on female geriatric abuse during the COVID-19 crisis in India,"This study aims to reflect on how the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the social and economic vulnerability of Indian elderly women, thereby making them prone to varied forms of abuse and denying them of the basic rights of secured existence. This study was conducted by analyzing primary data from government sources that dealt with the aging Indian population and the common predicaments that elderly women experienced during the pandemic. A qualitative interview was conducted in three old-age homes in India where the experiences of 26 elderly female residents were documented for understanding their experiences during the pandemic. The secondary data collected from different newspaper articles and online resources also enabled in perusing the difficulties that they faced both at home and the caregiving space at the critical juncture of COVID-19. Nearly 73% of the elderly population in the country has faced an incidence in different forms of abuse and exploitation during the subsequent waves of the pandemic. Disrespect and neglect were the most common type of mistreatment and around 23.1% reported physical assault. The elderly women were victimized further on socioeconomic grounds and their rights of living a secured and dignified life were significantly neglected. The basic premise of this paper operates on the ground that the family as an institution has shunned taking care of the responsibilities vis-a-vis the elderly and therefore formal institutions have been introduced to aid in the conventional caretaking responsibilities in the Indian societal structure. This situation became all the more grave during the pandemic and therefore needed much intervention. This paper follows the theoretical lens of gender theory and case study method to analyze the data. The HelpAge India report findings entail that elderly women/widows are doubly marginalized in the Indian society, and the COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the caregiver stress on manifold levels, thus exacerbating the problem. As most of the female senior citizens are economically dependent on their children and relatives, financial exploitation became one of the important premise that deprived them of a healthy living both at home and elderly caregiving institution. Despite the prevalence of certain elderly assistance schemes in the country, the older women’s needs and well-being got heavily impacted and their voice gets hardly recognized in the wider spectrum of sociopolitical events. To extend the requisite help and assistance to this socially vulnerable section, the government on September, 2021, launched a pan-India, toll-free helpline number “Elder Line” to provide relevant information on elderly legal and medical aid and guidance on procuring pension. According to the secondary findings, a significant percentage of elderly women have been susceptible to physical and emotional abuse and factors such as widowhood, economic dependency, physical infirmity, cognitive impairment along with other stressors have aggravated their exposure to ill-treatment during the pandemic span. Thus, to recognize and mitigate the existing problems affecting the elderly subjects, the government should devise the necessary protocols and adopt essential measures to ensure the welfare of the marginalized section and protect their basic rights of a holistic existence.","Compromised well-being: Implications on female geriatric abuse during the COVID-19 crisis in India This study aims to reflect on how the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the social and economic vulnerability of Indian elderly women, thereby making them prone to varied forms of abuse and denying them of the basic rights of secured existence.

B. Fang; E. Yan,2021,social science,English,Abuse of Older Persons With Cognitive and Physical Impairments: Comparing Percentages Across Informants and Operational Definitions,"This study compared percentages of elder abuse reported by older adults and their family caregivers, using reports from attending medical professionals to triangulate the reports. Percentages were also compared using different criteria proposed in the literature. In total, 1,002 older Chinese aged 55 years or above and their primary family caregivers were recruited from three leading public hospitals in Guangdong, People’s Republic of China. Caregivers and care recipients were separately interviewed and provided information on their demographic characteristics and past year percentages of abuse. A clinical team including a chief physician, two attending physicians, three resident physicians, and two senior nurses provided observer measures through reviewing the medical records and their daily observations. Regardless of the informants and operational definitions used, caregiver neglect was the most commonly reported (35.4% to 65.0%), followed by psychological abuse (11.1% to 51.1%), financial exploitation (17.9% to 40.8%), and physical abuse (0.8% to 2.2%). This study found huge variations in percentages of elder abuse by different informants and operational definitions. Depending on the types of abuse concerned, different informants should be consulted to yield more reliable estimates.","Abuse of Older Persons With Cognitive and Physical Impairments: Comparing Percentages Across Informants and Operational Definitions This study compared percentages of elder abuse reported by older adults and their family caregivers, using reports from attending medical professionals to triangulate the reports.

"Reisig, Michael D.;Holtfreter, Kristy",2018,social science,English,The victim–offender overlap in late adulthood,"This study contributes to the general knowledge of the victim–offender overlap by determining whether the phenomenon exists among older adults and whether known correlates of crime and victimization explain the relationship. Cross-sectional survey data from telephone interviews conducted with individuals 60 years and older (N = 2,000) residing in Arizona and Florida are used to estimate confirmatory factor models for both victimization and criminal offending. The results from a series of multivariate regression models show that victimization is associated with criminal offending. While factors such as low self-control, depression, and spending time in commercial drinking establishments partially attenuate the victimization–crime link, the statistically significant relationship persists in a multivariate context. Further testing indicates that the observed findings are robust across measurement and modeling strategies. Coupled with prior research, the results support the argument that the victim–offender overlap exists (and is difficult to explain) over the life course.","The victim–offender overlap in late adulthood This study contributes to the general knowledge of the victim–offender overlap by determining whether the phenomenon exists among older adults and whether known correlates of crime and victimization explain the relationship.

Key measures included the Elder Risk for Fraud Scale, the short Big Five Inventory, and the Emotional-Social Loneliness Inventory. Regression analyses found that agreeableness personality was associated with lower risks for fraud while social loneliness was associated with higher risks for fraud. Older participants who needed medical assistance with their daily living were found at higher risks for fraud than their counterparts without medical needs. It is recommendded that policymakers and helping professionals in China should assess psychosocial risk factors for fraud.

Three focus groups of Chinese American elders and one group of service professionals recruited from Phoenix metropolitan areas shared their insights of financial maltreatment and contributed to the refinement of questions in the followed survey that included 325 elders (Mage = 75.6, SD = 7.00). Two types of financial maltreatment: Financial exploitation and financial neglect were identified from focus group discussions. About 9.2% experienced financial exploitation and 1.5% experienced financial neglect. Both financial exploitation and neglect were related to higher vulnerability scores for abuse assessed using the H-S/EAST elder abuse screening scale. Financial maltreatment needs to be understood in legal, cultural, and family contexts, incorporating the perspectives of older adults. Prevention of financial maltreatment hinges on increased awareness and knowledge of this issue among elders, families and service professionals, and the collaborative efforts of stakeholders from ethnic communities.","Financial Maltreatment of Chinese American Elders: An Inquiry through a Cultural Lens This study examined financial maltreatment from the perspectives of Chinese American elders via a mixed method approach.

"Gao, Xiang;Sun, Fei;Hodge, David R.",2019,social science,English,Elder mistreatment among Chinese American families: Do acculturation and traditionalism matter?,"This study examined the effect of acculturation and Chinese traditionalism on elder mistreatment (EM) among Chinese American older adults. We used a mixed method design in this 2-phase cross-sectional exploratory study conducted in the Phoenix metropolitan area. In Phase I, we conducted four focus groups to develop a culturally relevant EM assessment tool. In Phase II, we administered a survey incorporating this tool to 266 community-dwelling Chinese American older adults aged 60 and older. Acculturation was measured using the Marin acculturation scale. Traditionalism was measured with questions drawn from the Traditionality–Modernity subscale of the Chinese Personality Assessment Inventory (CPAI-2). The prevalence rates of elder abuse and elder neglect are 8.3% and 5.3%, respectively. Higher levels of acculturation and depression are positively associated with the occurrence of elder abuse (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06). Traditionalism is not significantly related to elder abuse or elder neglect. The results suggest that promoting traditional Chinese beliefs may not necessarily prevent EM among members of this population. Rather, EM prevention efforts might focus on building “bi-cultural” identities among both older adults and their adult children. Future research could explore the effect of intergenerational acculturation discrepancies on EM among members of this population.","Elder mistreatment among Chinese American families: Do acculturation and traditionalism matter?

Between 27% and 38% of the participants reported that they were likely to seek help from APS for different types of EM. Significant differences were found across the three Asian groups in their perceptions toward EM and intention to seek help from APS in the event of EM. However, many Asian American older adults in the study did not know about APS prior to participating in the study (75.5%) and other formal sources of help (66.3%).

"Smith, Judith R.",2015,social science,English,Expanding constructions of elder abuse and neglect: Older mothers’ subjective experiences,"This study examines elder abuse within the broader framework of parenting in later life and focuses on the experience of mothers with “difficult” adult children. The sample is low-income and minority older women (>62). Using constructive grounded theory, the analysis reveals that the women’s lens as mothers informs their explanations for not being able to take action to limit their adult children’s difficult/abusive behaviors. The author suggests the utility of incorporating a feminist framework that highlights adult child-to-mother violence as a means of increasing self-reporting of elder abuse and older women’s willingness to accept services.","Expanding constructions of elder abuse and neglect: Older mothers’ subjective experiences This study examines elder abuse within the broader framework of parenting in later life and focuses on the experience of mothers with “difficult” adult children.

M. Evandrou; J. C. Falkingham; M. Qin; A. Vlachantoni,2017,social science,English,Elder abuse as a risk factor for psychological distress among older adults in India: a cross-sectional study,"This study examines the association between elder abuse and psychological distress among older adults in India and explores whether this association varies by the level of psychosocial and material resources. The study uses a cross-sectional survey design. The data are drawn from a representative sample of 9589 adults aged 60 and above in seven Indian states—Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu—in 2011. Secondary analysis, using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models, is conducted using the United Nations Population Fund project Building Knowledge Base on Ageing in India survey. Elder abuse (physical and/or emotional) emanating from family members in the previous month before the survey is examined. Multivariate models are run on the total analytical sample and for men and women separately. The overall prevalence of psychological distress among persons aged 60 and over living in the seven Indian States is 40.6%. Among those older persons who experienced some form of physical or emotional abuse or violence in the last month, the prevalence of psychological distress is much higher than that in the general older population, at 61.6% (p<0.001). The results show that the experience of abuse is negatively associated with the mental health of older adults, and this relationship persists even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors (OR=1.60, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.09). The findings also suggest that household wealth has an inverse relationship with mental health, with the association between experiencing elder abuse and reporting poor mental health being strongest among older people in wealthy households. Elder abuse in India is currently a neglected phenomenon, and greater recognition of the link between abuse and mental health is critical to improve the well-being of vulnerable older adults, some of whom may be ‘hidden’ within well-off households.","Elder abuse as a risk factor for psychological distress among older adults in India: a cross-sectional study This study examines the association between elder abuse and psychological distress among older adults in India and explores whether this association varies by the level of psychosocial and material resources.

Correlates were then examined using survey logistic regression models. More than 1 in 10 adults who are 70 years of age or older (14.0%) have experienced some form of abuse in the past year, with 12.1% experiencing psychological abuse and 1.7% experiencing physical abuse. One in five victims (20.8%) were abused by both intimate and nonintimate partners. Health care insecurity was the strongest correlate of past-year abuse. The odds of experiencing abuse were 4.53 times greater for those who experienced health care insecurity than for those who did not.

"Giannouli, Vaitsa;Tsolaki, Magda",2023,medical,English,"What goes wrong with the perceptions of elder financial abuse? Data from older adults, healthcare professionals and students from Greece","This study examines what healthcare professionals, students and older adults believe about elder financial abuse in Greece. Participants responded to two vignettes by choosing which characteristics indicate elder financial abuse. Greeks are less likely to perceive financial exploitation when the perpetrator is a close family member, but are more likely to recognize it when perpetrated by paid caregivers or more distant (male) relatives. Signing over the victim’s property to another is less likely to be perceived as elder abuse than is the taking of money from bank accounts, even though the property is often worth more than what is taken from the account. Although there are some differences in perception between healthcare professionals and others in Greek society, these (and other anomalies) make it difficult to accurately report and prevent elder financial abuse in Greece.","What goes wrong with the perceptions of elder financial abuse?

Exploratory qualitative interviews were carried out with purposive sample of 23 nursing staff members. They were recruited from different institutions caring for older patients in the north-western region of Switzerland. These interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Participating nursing staff members reported several factors pertaining to the care provider, the older patient, and the institution that precipitated abuse and neglect. They mentioned different solutions that could help them address their responsibilities in a reasonable manner. The solutions included, for example, ensuring proper education and training, better management nursing care provider's responsibilities and timely intervention to address abuse and neglect, as well as rotating care provider. Implementing these suggestions will allow geriatric institutions, its managers, and nursing care providers to improve quality of care and reduce such negative occurrences in these settings.","Preventing elder abuse and neglect in geriatric institutions: Solutions from nursing care providers This study explores how and why abuse and neglect occurs in geriatric institutions and presents practical prevention measures.

Hu,2023,social science,English,Associated factors of discrepancy between older adults and their family caregivers in reporting elder abuse,"This study focuses on elder abuse against older adults with mild-to-moderate cognitive and physical impairment who were receiving family care in Chinese context. Specifically, the study examined the associated factors of discrepancy between family caregiver and care recipient reports of elder abuse committed by the caregivers. Many studies identified the discrepancies between caregivers and care recipients reports of elder abuse, but they did not examine factors contributing to such discrepancies. Various cultural factors may contribute to the accuracy of elder abuse reports. A consecutive sample of 1,002 older adults with mild-to-moderate cognitive and physical impairment and their family caregivers was surveyed. Quantitative study with cross-sectional design. Moderate-to-substantial agreement in caregiver and care recipient reports was found for all forms of abuse (Cohen’s kappa = 0.39 to 0.76). Care recipient reports consistently generated higher rates than caregiver reports for psychological abuse (51.1% vs. 42.8%), physical abuse (1.2% vs. 1.0%), caregiver neglect (65.0% vs. 50.2%) and financial exploitation (40.8% vs. 34.2%). Similar factors were found for dyadic discrepancy in the reporting of various forms of elder abuse, which included desire to gain face, fear of losing face and sense of familism in the caregivers, as well as older age, cognitive impairment and female gender of the care recipient. This study was presented in adherence to the Strobe Checklist. The results suggest that family caregivers might not be reliable as the sole informants to report their care recipients’ victimization experiences. Information from multiple parties should be gathered and synthesized to obtain more accurate reporting of the frequency and severity of elder abuse. Meanwhile, cultural factors should be taken into account when seeking information related to elder abuse. There is a need for multiple parties to provide and report information about the elder abuse. It is also need to consider cultural factors when detecting and intervening elder abuse.","Associated factors of discrepancy between older adults and their family caregivers in reporting elder abuse This study focuses on elder abuse against older adults with mild-to-moderate cognitive and physical impairment who were receiving family care in Chinese context.

"Zhang, Weiguo",2019,social science,English,Perceptions of elder abuse and neglect by older Chinese immigrants in Canada,"This study investigates how older adults perceive elder abuse and neglect in the context of migration and ageing. Based on a qualitative study of recent Chinese older immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, it seeks to understand how migration and ageing processes, both of which engender cultural and contextual changes, shape and reshape views of elder abuse and neglect. The study argues that culture is important in older immigrants’ perceptions of elder abuse and neglect, yet individuals with the same cultural roots may differ in their conceptualizations. Further, such perceptions could change through interactions with peers and non-peers in the host society, and these, in turn, can be influenced by both cultural and structural factors.","Perceptions of elder abuse and neglect by older Chinese immigrants in Canada This study investigates how older adults perceive elder abuse and neglect in the context of migration and ageing.

A stress-buffering effect hypothesis,"This study investigates the influence of psychological elder abuse on life satisfaction levels in Thailand. This study also analyses the stress-buffering effect of social participation on the life satisfaction levels of Thai mentally abused elderly. Elder abuse has been proven to dramatically reduce Thai elders’ levels of life satisfaction as their function in society shrinks owing to ageism. As a result, individuals are more likely to lose their independence and status and be forced to rely on others, increasing the danger of abuse. Elder abuse has a more significant negative impact on life satisfaction levels among Thai older women. Nonetheless, the mentally abused elderly who participate in social activities are happier than those who do not. Thai elders who live with their daughters are more satisfied in life than those who do not, but living with adult offspring does not assist psychologically abused elders in escaping their psychological suffering.","Does social participation make Thai psychologically abused elders happier?

"Kong, Jooyoung;Easton, Scott D.",2019,health/care,English,Re-experiencing violence across the life course: Histories of childhood maltreatment and elder abuse victimization,"This study primarily examines the associations between histories of childhood maltreatment (i.e., neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse) and elder abuse victimization and explores whether gender moderates the associations. We conducted a secondary data analysis of 5,968 older adults (mean age = 71 years) based on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (2010–2011). Using retrospective self-reports of childhood and current (past 12 months) victimization experiences, logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of early-life adversities on the likelihood of elder abuse victimization. Results indicate that childhood emotional abuse and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) were associated with greater risk of being abused as older adults, after controlling for childhood and adult background factors. We also found that the effect of CSA on elder abuse victimization was weaker for women than men. Findings suggest that the phenomenon of revictimization may occur not only in early and middle adulthood, but also in late life. To advance our understanding of victimization across the life course, future research on root causes of elder abuse should include histories of child abuse.","Re-experiencing violence across the life course: Histories of childhood maltreatment and elder abuse victimization This study primarily examines the associations between histories of childhood maltreatment (i.e., neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse) and elder abuse victimization and explores whether gender moderates the associations.

"Chokkanathan, Srinivasan",2017,social science,English,Stressors social support and elder mistreatment,"This study sought to examine the pathways through which interpersonal relationship strain and loneliness (stressors) influence elder mistreatment. In addition, the study tested the buffer effects of social support within the stressor-mistreatment relationship. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 897 randomly selected older adults in rural Tamil Nadu, India. Mediation and moderation models were tested using the process module. Results showed that, in addition to the direct effects, interpersonal problems also influenced mistreatment via loneliness (partially mediating model). In the moderation model, social support buffered the influence of interpersonal strain on mistreatment (unconditional direct effect) and also buffered the influence of interpersonal strain on mistreatment through loneliness (conditional indirect effects). Intervention on mistreatment should involve elimination of risk factors and strengthening of social resources.","Stressors social support and elder mistreatment This study sought to examine the pathways through which interpersonal relationship strain and loneliness (stressors) influence elder mistreatment.

The sample in this cross-sectional study consisted of 691 older adults. Data were collected with an elder abuse and neglect assessment form, which had been prepared by the researchers in accordance with the literature. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors related to subtypes of elder abuse. In this study, 13.6% of the elderly subjects (n = 94) were exposed to at least one instance of abusive behaviour within the last year; emotional abuse was the most frequently occurring type of abuse. Risk factors for abuse were being 75 years old or older (odds ratio (OR) = 1.993, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.105–3.592), being illiterate (OR = 4.863, 95%CI: 2.809–8.417), lack of own income (OR = 2.189, 95%CI: 1.179–4.064), having bad family relationships (OR = 20.564, 95%CI: 5.453–77.554), and lack of own home (OR = 3.945,; 95%CI: 1.167–13.330). The results of this study showed that abuse was an important problem for the elderly population. Therefore, elderly individuals, especially those who are 75 years old or older, have a low education level, lack their own home, and lack their own income, should be evaluated for abuse.","Prevalence of elder abuse among community‐dwelling older adults in Turkey and its associated factors This study was performed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse among community-dwelling older adults and its associated risk factors.

Risk factors for abuse were being 75 years old or older (odds ratio (OR) = 1.993, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.105–3.592), being illiterate (OR = 4.863, 95%CI: 2.809–8.417), lack of own income (OR = 2.189, 95%CI: 1.179–4.064), having bad family relationships (OR = 20.564, 95%CI: 5.453–77.554), and lack of own home (OR = 3.945,; 95%CI: 1.167–13.330). The results of this study showed that abuse was an important problem for the elderly population. Therefore, elderly individuals, especially those who are 75 years old or older, have a low education level, lack their own home, and lack their own income, should be evaluated for abuse.",prevalence elder abuse communitydwelling older adults turkey associated factors study performed determine prevalence elder abuse communitydwelling older adults associated risk factors sample crosssectional study consisted 691 older adults data collected elder abuse neglect assessment form prepared researchers accordance literature logistic regression analysis identify factors related subtypes elder abuse study 136 elderly subjects n94 exposed instance abusive behaviour year emotional abuse frequently occurring type abuse risk factors abuse 75 years old older odds ratio or1993 95 confidence interval ci 11053592 illiterate or4863 95ci 28098417 lack income or2189 95ci 11794064 bad family relationships or20564 95ci 545377554 lack home or3945 95ci 116713330 results study showed abuse important problem elderly population elderly individuals especially 75years old older low education level lack home lack income evaluated abuse,prevalence elder abuse communitydwelling older adults turkey associated factors study performed determine prevalence elder abuse communitydwelling older adults associated risk factors sample crosssectional study consisted  older adults data collected elder abuse neglect assessment form prepared researchers accordance literature logistic regression analysis identify factors related subtypes elder abuse study 136 elderly subjects  exposed instance abusive behaviour year emotional abuse frequently occurring type abuse risk factors abuse 75 years old older odds ratio  95 confidence interval ci  illiterate  95ci  lack income  95ci   family relationships  95ci  lack home  95ci  results study showed abuse important problem elderly population elderly individuals especially  old older low education level lack home lack income evaluated abuse,prevalence elder abuse communitydwelling older adults turkey  factors study   prevalence elder abuse communitydwelling older adults  risk factors sample crosssectional study   older adults data collected elder abuse neglect assessment   researchers  literature logistic  analysis identify factors related  elder abuse study 136 elderly subjects    abusive  year  abuse frequently   abuse risk factors abuse  years old older odds ratio  95       95ci   income  95ci   family relationships  95ci 545377554  home  95ci  results study  abuse important problem elderly population elderly individuals especially  old older low education   home  income  abuse

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework, peer-reviewed articles published until September 2023 were identified in six electronic databases. Out of the manuscripts initially identified (n = 219), 28 articles met the selection criteria. The study’s quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The included studies provided a comprehensive overview of this phenomenon, encompassing data from 6,579 older rural women. Prevalence rates of abuse and neglect exhibited wide variability, with an average of 27.3%. Among the risk factors, financial dependence and incapacity stood out, while higher income and education levels were protective factors, among others. Emotional/psychological abuse emerged as the most common form, with significant impacts on older women’s physical and mental health. Cultural norms and gender expectations also influenced perceptions of abuse and victims’ coping mechanisms. In a context in which access to specialized resources and services is hampered by significant limitations, community awareness and education prove vital to address this issue, which positions social work as key to addressing these challenges. The prevalence of abuse against older rural women is significant. Emotional abuse stands out as a major issue, underscoring the need for comprehensive interventions accounting for cultural and gender factors.","Violence, Abuse and Neglect in Older Women in Rural and Remote Areas: A Scoping Review and Prevalence Meta-Analysis This systematic review addressed the issue of the abuse and neglect of older women (age 60 and over) in rural and remote areas, examining these phenomena’s prevalence, risk and protective factors, consequences, and associated perceptions.

"Tomoko Hamasaki, Akihito Hagihara",2021,social science,English,Medical malpractice litigation related to choking accidents in older people in Japan,"To analyse malpractice litigation cases in Japan and identify the factors related to choking accidents in older people. Choking while eating is common in older people and has potentially severe consequences. This study analysed court decisions related to choking accidents occurring in Japan between 2000 and 2015 that involved the death of an older person or permanent severe choking-related injury. A database of court decisions (n = 23) was constructed according to patient and caregiver characteristics, and nursing services. An analysis was performed on caregiver liability, and to identify factors related to choking accidents. The court ruled that the caregiver was liable in 10 of the 23 cases. Liability was related to appropriate food choices, failure to monitor of eating or the non-performance of resuscitation after an accident. Prior knowledge of aspiration (P < .001), inappropriate assistance during the meal (P < .001), and inappropriate emergency treatment (P = .028) were more likely to be present in cases in which caregivers were judged liable than in those in which they were not. Lack of appropriate assistance during the meal was the factor most strongly associated with a court ruling of caregiver liability for choking accidents in older people.","Medical malpractice litigation related to choking accidents in older people in Japan To analyse malpractice litigation cases in Japan and identify the factors related to choking accidents in older people.

Ostaszkiewicz J.,2018,health/care,English,A conceptual model of the risk of elder abuse posed by incontinence and care dependence,"To describe and critically analyse the thinking that led to the concept of an association between incontinence, care dependence and elder abuse. Coercive or abusive continence care practices include chastising a person for their incontinence and overriding their attempts to resist continence care. Neglect in continence care is characterised by withholding or delaying responding to requests for help to maintain continence or to manage incontinence, and restricting a person's access to toileting assistance, incontinence aids or hygiene care. Contemporary biomedical understandings about incontinence and influencing concepts from the fields of sociology, psychology and nursing were analysed to inform the design of a conceptual model that elucidates possible associations between incontinence, care dependence and elder abuse. Ideas generated from an analysis of the concepts led to the development of a model termed the “Model of Attributes to Abuse of Dependent Elders in Continence Care” (MADE-CC). The MADE-CC theorises factors that cause and contribute to abuse in continence care. Carer factors include physical and emotional exhaustion, frustration related to the inability to control or predict incontinence, resentment associated with constraints imposed by care dependence, disgust associated with physical contact with urine/faeces, limited knowledge and skills about incontinence and ethical conflicts concerning care. Care recipient factors include frequent and severe incontinence, cognitive impairment and a history of physical or psychological trauma. Social factors that are theorised include the stigmatised nature of incontinence, social taboos and cultural norms and the private nature of continence care. The MADE-CC illuminates the potential risk of elder abuse posed by incontinence and care dependence. It should be used to improve ethical care of older people and stimulate debate about everyday ethics in the care of older people who are care dependent and to optimise their participation in decisions about their health and well-being. Nurses and carers should be aware of the multiple interrelated factors that contribute to the risk of elder abuse in the caregiving encounter, including the role of emotions.","A conceptual model of the risk of elder abuse posed by incontinence and care dependence To describe and critically analyse the thinking that led to the concept of an association between incontinence, care dependence and elder abuse.

Mistreatment of older people, particularly neglect, has emerged as a significant public health concern worldwide. However, few studies have been conducted to examine neglect of older people in low- and middle-income countries. Most research has focused on estimating the prevalence of neglect in older populations with little emphasis on the perceptions of healthcare professionals and their role in addressing neglect of older people. Qualitative secondary analysis. The parent study consisted of nine focus groups conducted with healthcare professionals at five public hospitals in Mexico. The purpose of the parent study was to perform a needs assessment to determine the feasibility of adapting the Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders programme to Mexico. A qualitative secondary analysis with directed content analysis approach was used to extract data related to neglect of older people. A total of 89 participants representing healthcare professionals from several disciplines were interviewed. Three themes emerged: (i) The main point is not here; (ii) We feel hopeless; and (iii) We need preparation. Participants reported distress and hopelessness related to neglect of older people. Lack of community-based resources was noted as contributing to neglect. Increased education regarding care of older people for both caregivers and healthcare professionals and greater interdisciplinary collaboration were identified as potential solutions to combat neglect. Community-based services and resource allocation need to be re-evaluated to improve the care of older Mexicans. Interdisciplinary models of care should be developed to address concerns related to neglect of older people. Neglect negatively impacts healthcare professionals’ ability to adequately care for older patients. There is a need to invest in community-based services and models of care to address these concerns.","Healthcare professionals’ perceptions of neglect of older people in Mexico: A qualitative secondary analysis To describe healthcare professionals’ perceptions of neglect of older people in Mexico.

Cross-sectional and descriptive research. Data were taken from the SABE Colombia Survey, a population study, with a national representative sample of 23,694 adults aged over 60 years. Presence and type of abuse by partners or family members, members were investigated. Generalized linear models with Poisson link function were used to estimate the causes of the prevalence of abuse by area of residence, region, age, sex, dependence on activities of daily living and living arrangements. 15.1% of the elderly in Colombia reported some type of abuse, and over 50% reported more than one form of abuse. Abuse proportion is greater in people who are aged 60-69, in women, people with lower levels of education, people who belong to lower socioeconomic status, people who live alone, people who live with children, and people in urban areas. The most frequent abuse form is psychological, followed by neglect and physical abuse. Dependence on basic and instrumental daily living activities increases the probabilities of suffering abuse. Home is a risky place for the elderly people, especially for those with functional dependence, those who belong to low socioeconomic strata and women. Results should encourage debate among researchers, professionals and decision makers on public policy about necessary actions and means to change violent family dynamics in homes with elderly people.","Abuse in Colombian elderly and its association with socioeconomic conditions and functionality To describe the presence of abuse in elderly people in Colombia and its association with socio-demographic and functional conditions.

"Burnes, David;Pillemer, Karl;Lachs, Mark S.",2017,social science,English,Elder abuse severity: A critical but understudied dimension of victimization for clinicians and researchers,"To describe the variation in severity of elder emotional abuse, physical abuse, and neglect and identify factors associated with more severe forms of elder mistreatment (EM). Population-based study using random digit-dial sampling and telephone interviews with a representative sample (n = 4,156) of community-dwelling, cognitively intact older adults in New York State. The Conflict Tactics Scale and DUKE Older Americans Resources and Services scales were adapted to assess EM subtypes. For each EM subtype, severity was operationalized by summing the number of different mistreatment behaviors and the frequency of each behavior. Among older adults reporting some degree of mistreatment, ordinal or multinomial regression predicted severity of elder emotional abuse, physical abuse, and neglect. Distribution of EM severity was characterized by a negative/right skew. More severe emotional abuse was predicted by younger age, living with the perpetrator only, Hispanic background, and higher education. Increasing physical abuse severity was associated with younger age and living only with the perpetrator. Higher neglect severity was associated with functional impairment, younger age, living only with the perpetrator, lower income, and lower education. The presence of nonperpetrator others living in the home served a protective function against escalating mistreatment severity. Extends existing EM risk factor research by operationalizing mistreatment phenomena along a continuum of severity. Findings enhance capacity to screen and report particularly vulnerable EM victims and inform targeted interventions to ameliorate the problem. Incorporation of severity into EM research/measurement reflects the clinical and phenomenological reality of the problem.","Elder abuse severity: A critical but understudied dimension of victimization for clinicians and researchers To describe the variation in severity of elder emotional abuse, physical abuse, and neglect and identify factors associated with more severe forms of elder mistreatment (EM).

Our primary aim was to identify the most salient indicators of elder abuse and neglect for potential inclusion on a screening tool. We also sought to identify practical elements of the tool that would optimize EMT uptake and use in the field, such as format, length and number of items, and types of response options available. Qualitative data were collected from 23 EMTs and Adult Protective Services (APS) caseworkers that participated in one of five semi-structured focus groups. Focus group data were iteratively coded by two coders using inductive thematic identification and data reduction. Findings were subject to interpretation by the research team. EMTs and APS caseworks identified eight domains of items that might be included on a screening tool: (1) exterior home condition; (2) interior living conditions; (3) social support; (4) medical history; (5) caregiving quality; (6) physical condition of the older adult; (7) older adult’s behavior; and, (8) EMTs instincts. The screening tool should be based on observable cues in the physical or social environment, be very brief, easily integrated into electronic charting systems, and provide a decision rule for reporting guidance to optimize utility for EMTs in the field. We described characteristics of a screening tool for EMTs to enhance detection and reporting of elder abuse and neglect to APS. Future research should narrow identified items and evaluate how these domains positively predict confirmed cases of elder abuse and neglect.","Towards the development of a screening tool to enhance the detection of elder abuse and neglect by emergency medical technicians (EMTs): a qualitative study To develop a screening tool to enhance elder abuse and neglect detection and reporting rates among emergency medical technicians (EMTs).

"Evans, Christopher S.;Hunold, Katherine M.;Rosen, Tony;Platts‐Mills, Timothy F.",2017,medical,English,Diagnosis of elder abuse in U.S. emergency departments,"To estimate the proportion of visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) in which a diagnosis of elder abuse is reached using two nationally representative datasets. Retrospective cross-sectional analysis. U.S. ED visits recorded in the 2012 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) or the 2011 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). All ED visits of individuals aged 60 and older. The primary outcome was elder abuse defined according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. The proportion of visits with elder abuse was estimated using survey weights. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to identify demographic characteristics and common ED diagnoses associated with elder abuse. In 2012, NEDS contained information on 6,723,667 ED visits of older adults, representing an estimated 29,056,673 ED visits. Elder abuse was diagnosed in an estimated 3,846 visits, corresponding to a weighted diagnosis period prevalence of elder abuse in U.S. EDs of 0.013% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.012–0.015%). Neglect and physical abuse were the most common types diagnosed, accounting for 32.9% and 32.2% of cases, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed greater weighted odds of elder abuse diagnosis in women (odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.68–2.26) and individuals with contusions (OR = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.36–3.57), urinary tract infection (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.84–2.65), and septicemia (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.44–2.55). In the 2011 NHAMCS dataset, no cases of elder abuse were recorded for the 5,965 older adult ED visits. The proportion of U.S. ED visits by older adults receiving a diagnosis of elder abuse is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the estimated prevalence in the population. Efforts to improve the identification of elder abuse in EDs may be warranted.","Diagnosis of elder abuse in U.S. emergency departments To estimate the proportion of visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) in which a diagnosis of elder abuse is reached using two nationally representative datasets.

"Pickering, Carolyn E. Z.;Yefimova, Maria;Wang, Danny;Maxwell, Christopher D.;Jablonski, Rita",2022,health/care,English,Dynamic structural equation modelling evaluating the progressively lowered stress threshold as an explanation for behavioural symptoms of dementia,"To evaluate the progressively lowered stress threshold (PLST) conceptual model as an explanation for behavioural symptoms of dementia and test several of its hypothesized propositions. The PLST model suggests that due to impairments in coping, persons living with dementia have a reduced threshold for stress and respond with more behavioural symptoms of dementia as stress accumulates throughout the day. Intensive longitudinal design. A sample of N = 165 family caregivers completed brief daily diary surveys for 21 days between the dates of 7/2019 and 8/2020, reporting on a total of 2841 days. Dynamic structural equation modelling was used as the analytic technique to examine the impact of caregiver and care recipient environmental stressors on the diversity of behavioural symptoms of dementia to account for the nested data structure and autoregressive relationships. Results show direct relationships between environmental stressors and diversity of behavioural symptoms of dementia that same day and the following day. Findings provide support for the PLST model propositions. Further, findings suggest an extension to the conceptual model is warranted given evidence of an exposure/recovery trajectory and the lagged effects of stress exposure on behavioural symptoms of dementia presentation. This study tested whether a commonly used nursing model does in fact explain the occurrence of behavioural symptoms of dementia. The main findings support using the model as an intervention framework and suggest the model should be adapted to consider recovery trajectories. Since behavioural symptoms of dementia represent complex and dynamic temporal phenomena, traditional longitudinal assessments and analyses are an insufficient measurement modality for testing models. Findings inform the design of environmental-modification type interventions for behavioural symptoms of dementia management and the methods to evaluate such interventions.","Dynamic structural equation modelling evaluating the progressively lowered stress threshold as an explanation for behavioural symptoms of dementia To evaluate the progressively lowered stress threshold (PLST) conceptual model as an explanation for behavioural symptoms of dementia and test several of its hypothesized propositions.

Using 2-year longitudinal data, we analyzed a consecutive sample of 800 Chinese primary family CGs and their CRs with mild cognitive impairment or mild-to-moderate dementia recruited from the geriatric and neurological departments of 3 Grade-A hospitals in the People’s Republic of China. Participatory dyads were assessed between September 2015 and February 2016 and followed for 2 years. CG depression at baseline was associated with a sharper increase in psychological abuse and neglect. For CRs with increased NPS, having a depressed CG predicted a higher level of psychological abuse than for those CRs without NPS. For CGs with decreased burden, the level of depression was associated with a slower increase in neglect than for CGs who remained low burden. This study showed the differential impact of CG depression on the increase in elder mistreatment depending on the change in CR NPS and CG-perceived burden. The present findings provide valuable insights into the design of a systematic and integrative intervention protocol for elder mistreatment that simultaneously focuses on treating CG depression and perceived burden and CR NPS.","Association between caregiver depression and elder mistreatment—Examining the moderating effect of care recipient neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver-perceived burden To examine the association between caregiver (CG) depression and increase in elder mistreatment and to investigate whether change in care recipient (CR) neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and change in CG-perceived burden influence this association.

Two-year prospective cohort study. Kuala Pilah, a district in Negeri Sembilan approximately 100 km from the capital city, Kuala Lumpur. Community-dwelling older adults aged 60 and older. Using a multistage cluster sampling strategy, 1,927 respondents were recruited and assessed at baseline, of whom 1,189 were re-assessed 2 years later. EAN was determined using the modified Conflict Tactic Scale, and chronic pain was assessed through self-report using validated questions. The prevalence of chronic pain was 20.4%. Cross-sectional results revealed 8 variables significantly associated with chronic pain—age, education, income, comorbidities, self-rated health, depression, gait speed, and EAN. Abused elderly adults were 1.52 times as likely to have chronic pain (odds ratio=1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.03–2.27), although longitudinal analyses showed no relationship between EAN and risk of chronic pain (risk ratio=1.14, 95% CI=0.81–1.60). This lack of causal link was consistent when comparing analysis with complete cases with that of imputed data. Our findings indicate no temporal relationship between EAN and chronic pain but indicated cross-sectional associations between the two. This might indicate that, although EAN does not lead to chronic pain, individuals with greater physical limitations are more vulnerable to abuse. Our study also shows the importance of cohort design in determining causal relationships between EAN and potentially linked health outcomes.","Elder abuse and chronic pain: Cross‐sectional and longitudinal results from the Preventing Elder Abuse and Neglect Initiative To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between elder abuse and neglect (EAN) and chronic pain in rural older Malaysians.

"Gironda, Melanie W.;Nguyen, Annie L.;Mosqueda, Laura M.",2016,medical,English,Is this broken bone because of abuse? Characteristics and comorbid diagnoses in older adults with fractures,"To examine the relationship between individual characteristics and potential correlates of elder abuse in older adults who present with fractures. Cross-sectional analysis of deidentified data extracted from medical records. Academic medical center. Individuals aged 65 and with a primary diagnosis of any fracture admitted to an outpatient department or emergency department (ED) in a single southern California medical center over a 36-month period (N = 652). Participant characteristics included demographic characteristics, number of medical visits, and point of service. Corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, E-codes, and V-codes were extracted to identify cause, location, and type of fracture. The presence of 13 potential correlates of abuse as captured by ICD-9 codes were extracted and summed. Descriptive statistics and regression models were used for analyses. Mean age of participants was 77.2, 58% were female (58%), 60% were white (60%), and 46% had one or more potential correlates of abuse. In bivariate analyses, older age (≥80), dementia, seeking care in the ED (vs inpatient or outpatient clinics), only one visit to a medical facility (vs multiple visits) in the 36-month study period, cause of fracture as something other than a fall, and fractures of the head or face were more likely to have at least one correlate of abuse. In logistic regression, dementia (B = 0.794, standard error (SE) = 0.280); seeking care in the ED (vs outpatient or outpatient clinics) (B = 1.86, SE = 0.302); at least two visits to a medical facility (vs multiple visits) (B = −0.585, SE = 0.343); and fracture of the back (B = 0.730, SE = 0.289), head (B = 1.22, SE = 0.333), and face (B = 1.28, SE = 0.474) were associated with the presence of at least one correlate of abuse. Certain characteristics in older adults with fracture are associated with potential correlates of abuse.

Though the majority of APS' workforce is staffed by social workers, some programmes also employ nurses. Secondary data analysis using convergent parallel mixed-method design was conducted. Using survey data from the National Adult Protective Services Association, 99 nurses' responses between October 2014 and August 2015 were analysed to examine their agency characteristics, training and qualities, job responsibilities and interprofessional collaboration. The majority of nurses work with social workers or other professionals using a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach. Among those carrying a caseload, 69% (49 out of 71) of nurses work in conjunction with social workers. Out of all nurses, 64% (63 out of 99) indicated participation in at least one MDT. While the responsibilities nurses provided were similar to social workers, nurses were also able to provide healthcare related services, in their professional competencies, without referral. Nurses in APS are in a privileged position to investigate mistreatment and provide/coordinate direct care for victims. Not much was known about nurses who directly investigate elder mistreatment and provide services to victims. This study was the first to highlight the nursing workforce in APS, and described the nurses' unique contribution to the field. Nurses functioned as both social workers and healthcare professionals in APS. Since victims of elder mistreatment often suffer from negative physical, psychological and social consequences, having nurses in APS benefits victims to receive and the programmes in providing better care and services.","Examining nurses' role in Adult Protective Services related to safeguarding older people To examine the role of Adult Protective Services' (APS's) nurses in helping abused, neglected and exploited older people, this study investigated how nurses' contribution differs from social workers.

The mutually reported rates were 9.7%, 0.8%, 33.2%, and 39.7% for psychological abuse, physical abuse, financial exploitation, and caregiver neglect respectively. Caregiver burden, care recipient neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairments are prominent risk factors, while protective factors associated with multiple abuse subtypes include caregiver’s use of emotion-focused and solution-focused coping, perception of familism, and premorbid relationship rewards. Distinct factors were observed for respective forms of abuse. Psychological abuse with family poverty; Caregiver neglect with caregiver’s substance use and poor physical health; Financial exploitation with caregiver’s neurotic personality, as well as care recipient’s younger age, absence of chronic illness, and co-residence between the caregiver and care recipient.

Over 34 % of participants reported experiencing lifetime psychological, 11.5 % physical, 18.5 % financial and 5 % sexual abuse and 4.3 % reported injuries. Lifetime psychological abuse was associated with country, younger age, education and alcohol consumption; physical abuse with country, age, not living in partnership; injuries with country, female sex, age, education, not living in partnership; financial abuse with country, age, not living in partnership, education, benefiting social/partner income, drinking alcohol; and sexual abuse with country, female sex and financial strain. High lifetime prevalence rates confirm that elder abuse is a considerable public health problem warranting further longitudinal studies. Country of residence is an independent factor associated with all types of elder abuse which highlights the importance of national interventions alongside international collaborations.","The prevalence of lifetime abuse among older adults in seven European countries To investigate the lifetime prevalence rate of abuse among older persons and to scrutinize the associated factors (e.g. demographics).

Population-based epidemiological study. Greater Chicago area. Chinese Americans aged 60 and older (N=3,157). Data were collected from 2011 to 2017, with mortality data collected over the subsequent 4 years. Face-to-face in-home interviews were conducted. EM was measured using a brief screening tool (10 items) and a detailed assessment (56 items) and defined using different criteria for overall and specific subtypes of EM. Mortality was ascertained during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Four hundred seventy-five (15.2%) participants reported EM. Severe and moderate EM were associated with greater risk of 1-year (hazard ratio (HR)=2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04–6.03; HR=2.55, 95% CI=1.08–6.03), 2-year (HR=1.68, 95% CI=1.01–2.78; HR=1.69, 95% CI=1.04–2.74), 3-year (HR=1.73, 95% CI=1.17–2.55; HR=1.73, 95% CI=1.19–2.51) and 4-year (HR=1.51, 95% CI=1.08–2.10; HR=1.48, 95% CI=1.08–2.04) mortality. A broad definition of EM was associated with greater risk of 3-year and 4-year mortality. With respect to subtypes of EM, psychological mistreatment and caregiver neglect were associated with greater mortality risk, whereas the relationships between psychological mistreatment, caregiver neglect and mortality risk varied according to definitional criteria. Different definitions and subtypes of EM had different associations with mortality in Chinese-American older adults. This study challenges assumptions about consequences of EM and calls for customized interventions for EM in minority populations.

"Fang, Boye;Yan, Elsie;Yang, Xiaozhao;Pei, Yaolin",2021,social science,English,Association between caregiver neurotic personality trait and elder abuse: Investigating the moderating role of change in the level of caregiver perceived burden,"To investigate whether caregiver neuroticism affects the level of elder abuse and whether changes of caregiver perceived burden alter this relationship. Using 2-year longitudinal data, a consecutive sample of 800 Chinese family caregivers and their care recipients with dementia were recruited from the geriatric and neurological departments of 3 grade-A hospitals in the People’s Republic of China. All the participatory dyads were assessed between September 2015 and February 2016 and followed up for 2 years. Significant increase in the prevalence was found for physical abuse, psychological abuse, and caregiver neglect. Caregiver neuroticism was associated with an increased level of physical and psychological abuse over the 2-year observation period; however, change in the level of caregiver perceived burden altered this association. Specifically, the absence and decrease of perceived care burden prevented an increase in the level of physical and psychological abuse among caregivers high in neuroticism. Although caregiver neuroticism was also associated with an increased level of caregiver neglect, caregiver perceived burden did not appear to have an impact on this relationship. This study provided evidence that caregiver neuroticism was associated with an increased level of physical and psychological abuse, while changes in the level of caregiver perceived burden may alter this trajectory. These findings suggest the importance of implementing caregiver-centered intervention and prevention programs for elder abuse by specifically targeting caregivers’ behaviors related to their neurotic personality trait and cognitive appraisal of caregiving stressors associated with such personality traits.","Association between caregiver neurotic personality trait and elder abuse: Investigating the moderating role of change in the level of caregiver perceived burden To investigate whether caregiver neuroticism affects the level of elder abuse and whether changes of caregiver perceived burden alter this relationship.

Daughters have enduring, unique relationships with their mothers that often carry over into caregiving. Pre-caregiving relationship quality is related to many caregiving outcomes, although it is unclear how. Qualitative study. Grounded theory design, informed by feminism, with telephone interviews conducted between January 2013–July 2013. The sample (N = 13) was recruited through an online recruitment strategy, with advertisements posted on relevant websites asking ‘Are you in an abusive relationship with your ageing mother?’ Daughters used coping strategies and self-protective strategies aimed at decreasing their exposure to aggression and emotional distress when interacting with their ageing mothers. Daughters also used spiteful aggression out of the desire for revenge. Although the daughters' strategies served their personal needs, they jeopardized the mothers' needs by creating an environment where neglect could occur. Daughters also readily and intentionally used aggression against their mothers. These were strategies daughters have found useful. These strategies may be potential areas for designing interventions to promote healthy family relationships and decrease the occurrence of elder abuse and neglect.","Relationship management strategies for daughters in conflicted relationships with their ageing mothers To study relationship management strategies of daughters in conflicted relationships with their mothers and how they promoted or prevented elder abuse.

Articles published between 2005–2019 were retrieved and underwent data analysis and knowledge synthesis. The review was presented under the categories of the dyadic approach of elder abuse in connection with the role of caregiver (risk) and care recipient (vulnerability) by Fulmer et al. (2005). The search process led to 12 quantitative studies, including an intervention, a prospective, nine surveys, and a cross-sectional structural interview. Findings were synthesized and presented under ‘personal’, ‘physical and psychological’, and ‘social’ domains indicating the bilateral roles of caregiver and care recipient leading to abuse. This review depicted factors influencing abuse in the caring relationship between older people with memory disorders and their family caregivers at home.

Caretakers in Group 1 had a higher rate of four or more ACEs (47.0 % vs 5.1 % p <  0.001) while the increase for children was not statistically significant (61.4 % vs 51.1 %, p =  0.110). Both children and caretakers were referred to more services in Group 1 (2.7 + 1.5 vs 1.5 + 1.3, and 3.0 + 1.9 vs 1.2 + 1.2, respectively, p <  0.0001).

Torke,2014,medical,English,"Wishard Volunteer Advocates Program: an intervention for at-risk, incapacitated, unbefriended adults","Unbefriended, incapacitated individuals who lack surrogates to make medical decisions present a complex problem to the healthcare providers who treat them. Adults without surrogates are among the most vulnerable in the community and are often alone and estranged from family, neglected and abused, and at risk of receiving inappropriate medical treatment. This article describes the program model and outcomes for the first 2 years of the Wishard Volunteer Advocates Program (WVAP), a guardianship program using trained, supervised volunteers as surrogates for unbefriended, incapacitated individuals. Of the 50 individuals enrolled during the study period, 20 were female, and 39 were Caucasian and 11 African American. Their average age was 67. Nineteen were insured with Medicare as primary and Medicaid as supplementary insurance. Ninety-eight percent had four or more comorbid conditions at the time of the index hospitalization. Before program referral, many lived alone in unsafe conditions. Adult Protective Services was involved in almost half of the cases at the time of the index hospitalization. Approximately half of the participants required some type of property management. Healthcare usage data demonstrated that most were not receiving medical care before WVAP enrollment; the data indicated a decrease in emergency department visits and hospitalization after WVAP enrollment. The WVAP completed Medicaid applications for 12 participants, resulting in $297,481.62 in reimbursement for the index hospitalization and a payer source for subsequent hospitalization and long-term care. The volunteer advocate model provides an efficient and quality mechanism for providing unbefriended individuals with surrogates.","Wishard Volunteer Advocates Program: an intervention for at-risk, incapacitated, unbefriended adults Unbefriended, incapacitated individuals who lack surrogates to make medical decisions present a complex problem to the healthcare providers who treat them.

L. Lutz; M. F. Klinger; F. Holz; M. A. Verhoff; J. Amendt,2024,medical,English,How to prove neglect in the context of the post-mortem examination,"Understanding the causes, extent, and period of neglect is not only a medical but also a forensic task when it comes to legal investigations. In this study, we evaluated 46 autopsied cases where there was clear evidence of physical neglect during the last period of the deceased’s life. The age of the deceased ranged from 21 to 96 years; most of them were female (71.7%). The majority of cases (89.9%) took place in a domestic environment, with partners or relatives providing care. The most frequent post-mortem findings were pressure sores, followed by inflammatory skin changes, and signs of malnutrition and dehydration. Neglect was the cause or co-cause of death in 23% of the cases. More than half of the deceased showed severe contamination of the skin surface by excrement, and in almost 40% of the cases, fly infestation was found. The majority of insects belonged to the group of house flies (Diptera: Muscidae), mainly the common house fly, Musca domestica. By analyzing the entomological evidence, it was possible to prove an insect infestation period of at least several days ante-mortem. Since the period of neglect may be relevant in terms of legal proceedings, the present work demonstrates the particular importance of insect traces in providing this evidence. While prosecution and conviction of caregivers remain challenging, it is all the more essential that entomology and legal medicine collaborate on the analysis of findings of neglect.","How to prove neglect in the context of the post-mortem examination Understanding the causes, extent, and period of neglect is not only a medical but also a forensic task when it comes to legal investigations.

Pierce,2017,health/care,English,Identifying elder abuse & neglect among family caregiving dyads: A cross sectional study of psychometric properties of the QualCare scale,"Universal screening for elder abuse and neglect is a current controversy in geriatrics, fueled by the lack of evidence on valid and reliable instruments. Since each U.S. State and many other countries have their own legal definitions of what constitutes elder abuse and neglect, this further complicates instrument development and clinical assessment. The purpose of this paper is to present data on the sensitivity and specificity of the QualCare Scale, an instrument with utility in detecting clinically significant elder abuse and neglect among older adults receiving care at home. Data used in this analysis were collected during a training program in which trainees completed assessments (N = 80) of standardized case scenarios of caregiving dyads. Trainees completed the QualCare Scale during each assessment. This training program, including the assessments of the standardized case scenarios, was completed using a custom designed virtual-reality platform. Trainees were able to interact with the environment, older adult and caregiver within the case scenario. Thirty-six nurses and social workers from two Michigan Medicaid Waiver Sites participated in the training program. Each participant assessed between one and five scenarios, yielding the sample of 80 assessments used in this analysis. The research team designed each standardized case scenario to reflect whether or not the QualCare Scale subscale score should indicate reportable elder abuse and neglect per the State statute. Accordingly, the research team’s QualCare Scale scores for each scenario were used as the gold standard criterion of clinical significance for comparison against the participant’s assessment scores. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the six QualCare subscales was determined. Overall, the subscales had high sensitivity (≥0.811) but a wide range for specificity (0.167–1.000). The QualCare Scale can be an effective tool in detecting clinically significant elder abuse and neglect among older adults receiving care at home. This tool is suitable and feasible for use by practitioners working in home care. The QualCare Scale score indicating clinically significant or reportable elder abuse and neglect can be raised or lowered to be consistent with State or Country statutes, or simply used to create appropriate care plans to support caregiving. Findings from the QualCare Scale can support the multidisciplinary team in planning for and evaluating preventative interventions.","Identifying elder abuse & neglect among family caregiving dyads: A cross sectional study of psychometric properties of the QualCare scale Universal screening for elder abuse and neglect is a current controversy in geriatrics, fueled by the lack of evidence on valid and reliable instruments.

Risk and efficacy perceptions drive compliance in mass marketing scams,"Using a mix-method design, we examined participants’ willingness to respond to mass marketing scams (MMS). In Experiment 1, we examined the effect of age (young versus older) and letter style (“hot” versus “cold”) on the intention to respond. The intention of responding was negatively associated with risk (p < .001) and having at least a high school education was positively associated with perception of benefits (b = .684, p < .001). In Experiment 2, we examined reward sensitivity on the intention to respond by manipulating reward amounts (low versus high) and the presence of an activation fee. The presence of an activation fee decreased intent to contact, but percentages remained high (25.75%). Analyses of qualitative data indicated that risk and benefit were both predicted by perceived self-efficacy. The results indicate that consumers’ beliefs about their ability to control the outcomes of future interactions affected how they behaved when provided with MMS materials.","Why comply?

"Chokkanathan, Srinivasan",2021,social science,English,Experiences of elder mistreatment: A latent profile analysis,"Using a polyvictimization framework, this study seeks to identify profiles of older adults who are mistreated by their family members. Data were drawn from a survey (n = 897) on the prevalence of elder mistreatment in rural India. This study involved 187 community-dwelling older adults (aged 61 years and above) with experiences of mistreatment in the year prior to the interview. Mistreatment was assessed through an adapted version of the Conflict Tactics Scale. Latent profile analysis was conducted to classify older adults into empirically derived clusters. The best fitting model yielded three distinct profiles: multiple mistreatment all (high frequency), multiple mistreatment (predominantly psychological), and multiple mistreatment (predominantly neglect). The three clusters differed in terms of individual, familial, and perpetrator characteristics. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of elder mistreatment experiences and the need for specific interventions that address the needs of mistreated older adults.","Experiences of elder mistreatment: A latent profile analysis Using a polyvictimization framework, this study seeks to identify profiles of older adults who are mistreated by their family members.

"Ernst, Joy Swanson",2019,social science,English,Older adults neglected by their caregivers: Vulnerabilities and risks identified in an adult protective services sample,"Using a risk and vulnerability framework, the purpose of this paper is to describe the characteristics of older adults that Adult Protective Services (APS) substantiated for neglect by caregivers, their caregivers and the interrelationships between them. The paper uses a qualitative study of 21 APS case record narratives using a template analysis. Neglect related to withholding or refusing medical care was the most common. The older adults had multiple health conditions and geriatric syndromes. Caregivers had difficulties in carrying out caregiving role due to health and mental health issues, work responsibilities and lack of insight into older adults’ needs. The refusal to access or accept services by both the older adults and the caregivers was a predominant theme. The sample size was small, limited to one geographical area, and non-representative of all neglect cases. The data were extracted from written case narratives and not directly from the older adults and their family members. Case records varied in the case detail provided. To protect vulnerable older adults and improve quality of life, APS involvement in cases of caregiver neglect needs strategies to get people to accept help and access services to address multiple health and psychosocial problems for both older adult victims and their caregivers. This study provides in-depth information on APS cases involving caregiver neglect that add to understanding of this complex problem and points to areas for further study.","Older adults neglected by their caregivers: Vulnerabilities and risks identified in an adult protective services sample Using a risk and vulnerability framework, the purpose of this paper is to describe the characteristics of older adults that Adult Protective Services (APS) substantiated for neglect by caregivers, their caregivers and the interrelationships between them.

A total of 169 professionals (90% women) completed a survey in either French or English. Five topic areas emerged from the analysis: the influence of gender on the risk of abuse; types of abuse detected; knowledge gaps; capacity to respond to gender-based abuse; and awareness of resources. To gain further insight into these results, we conducted three focus groups with a total of 24 professionals. Professionals held relatively little recognition of, or knowledge about, gender related to elder abuse. Our results indicate the need to develop educational and awareness raising opportunities for professionals who work with abused older adults in both French and English to identify and respond to the unique needs of older women and men.","Exploring gender and elder abuse from the perspective of professionals We conducted an online survey of professionals working in two Canadian provinces to learn about their knowledge of elder abuse from a gender-based perspective.

T. Bruefach; D. C. Carr; N. Sachs-Ericsson,2023,social science,English,History of childhood mistreatment and the psychological health consequences of COVID-19 for older adults,"We examine the associations between childhood mistreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect) and older adults’ changes in depressive symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2018–June 2020). Using a community-based sample of older adults in North Florida (N = 581), we used ordinary least-squares regression to estimate associations between childhood mistreatments and depressive symptoms in June 2020, controlling for baseline symptoms and demographic characteristics. Additional models tested whether emotion regulation and social support attenuated associations between childhood mistreatments and depressive symptoms. Older adults exposed to emotional neglect in childhood saw a greater increase in depressive symptoms than those who did not experience childhood mistreatment. Those reporting childhood physical abuse had higher baseline depressive symptoms, but they did not increase during the pandemic. These associations remained stable after controlling for emotion regulation and social support, coping resources thought to contribute to linkages between childhood mistreatment and psychological health in adulthood. Childhood mistreatment might inform the psychological consequences of major stressors in later life. Thus, early life interventions for children experiencing mistreatment could be especially important for long-term psychological health outcomes and responses to major stressful events. Identifying older people with histories of childhood mistreatment could also help clinicians gauge patients’ risk of psychological decline during times such as the COVID-19 pandemic and tailor psychological health interventions.","History of childhood mistreatment and the psychological health consequences of COVID-19 for older adults We examine the associations between childhood mistreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect) and older adults’ changes in depressive symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2018–June 2020).

M. DeLiema; D. C. Homeier; D. Anglin; D. Li; K. H. Wilber,2016,social science,English,The Forensic Lens: Bringing Elder Neglect Into Focus in the Emergency Department,"We present 2 case studies of older patients who were brought to the emergency department (ED) in severely debilitated states. Both presented with severe malnutrition, contractures, and decubitus ulcers, and were nonverbal, with histories of dementia and end-stage disease. Their primary caregivers, adult children, were uncooperative with Adult Protective Services and disregarded treatment recommendations. Although both elders had signs suspicious for neglect, a comprehensive review revealed many layers of complexity. We use these cases to illustrate an approach to the assessment of possible elder neglect in ED settings and how to intervene to ensure patient safety. We begin with a discussion of the differences between willful, unintentional, and unsubstantiated neglect by a caregiver and then describe when to suspect neglect by evaluating the elder, interviewing the caregiver and first responders, assessing the caregiver’s ability to meet the elder’s needs, and, if possible, obtaining medical history and information about the home care environment. These cases illustrate the importance of careful documentation in cases of suspected neglect to assist investigative agencies, reduce the risk of further harm, and improve patient outcomes.","The Forensic Lens: Bringing Elder Neglect Into Focus in the Emergency Department We present 2 case studies of older patients who were brought to the emergency department (ED) in severely debilitated states.

Data came from nearly 900 community-dwelling participants from two ongoing cohort studies of aging. Financial fragility was determined by assessing an individual’s ability to access $2,000 within a month for an unexpected expense. Scam susceptibility was assessed via a 5-item instrument that measures perceptions and behaviors that predispose older adults to financial fraud and scams. On average, participants were 82 years of age. Nearly 10% reported financial fragility. Financial fragility was higher in Blacks and among those with fewer years of education, lower income, lower global cognition, lower literacy, and poorer financial decision-making. Regression analysis revealed that financially fragile older adults were more susceptible to scams. These data suggest that targeted efforts to reduce financial fragility and improve literacy and cognitive health are needed to prevent elder exploitation among diverse populations.","Financial fragility and scam susceptibility in community dwelling older adults We tested the hypothesis that financial fragility is associated with higher scam susceptibility in older adults without dementia.

A 41-question survey was administered to healthcare professionals, working in the Internal Medicine and Geriatric Wards of two different University Hospitals of Southern Italy, representative of the Italian health public system. The data collection resulted in 98 questionnaires. For the majority, neglect represents a type of abuse, whereas 40% of physicians and 37% of nurses considered this concept false. All the professionals recognized the elder abuse as a violation of the human rights, but 46.94% were not sure about the existence of standard procedures for abuse reporting/treatment. The most of the nurses and the care assistants declared they never had suspected or witnessed abuse, while few physicians stated to have suspected/witnessed abuse 1–3 times in their career. In both the suspected and witnessed cases, the healthcare personnel did not made any action, neither reported them to public authorities nor adult protective service agencies. The level of awareness and perception of elder abuse by healthcare professionals are still poor especially regarding the reporting procedures.

P. Du; Y. Chen,2021,law,English,Prevalence of elder abuse and victim-related risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in China,"With the accelerated aging of the Chinese population, elder abuse has become a serious social problem. As COVID-19 has had a very large impact on economic development and lifestyle in China, it has also affected elder abuse. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of elder abuse in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify changes in risk factors for elder abuse in the context of COVID-19. We designed a cross-sectional study. In Hunan Province, a face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted among elderly people over 65 years of age. To ensure the consistency of the measurement standards, we used the elder abuse questionnaire from the “Third Survey on Chinese Women’s Social Status.” According to related research, we selected 10 victim-related risk factors as independent variables. A logistic regression model was established to analyze the relationship between the independent variables and the four kinds of abuse. We collected 10,362 samples from Hunan Province. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of financial abuse and neglect was significantly higher than that in 2010. Income had a significant impact on the four types of abuse. The lower the income was, the greater the risk of abuse. Moreover, factors such as an older age, being a woman, a lower cognitive ability, and not having a cohabiting spouse increased the possibility of abuse. The greater the number of children was, the greater the risks of physical abuse, financial abuse, and elder neglect. Seniors with higher education levels, those who frequently participated in social activities, and those with religious beliefs were less likely to suffer abuse. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the prevalence of elder abuse in China has increased, which may be related to economic instability and social distancing measures. Increasing the income of the elderly and giving them more social support are important measures to reduce the prevalence of elder abuse.","Prevalence of elder abuse and victim-related risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in China With the accelerated aging of the Chinese population, elder abuse has become a serious social problem.

The Association Between Quality of Care and Job Characteristics in Residential Aged Care and Hospital Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Within residential aged care settings, reduced quality of care (QoC), abuse, and neglect have been global phenomena which require urgent intervention. As the reported rate of these problems is much higher in aged care compared to hospital settings, we investigated whether differing job design characteristics between the 2 settings might explain the difference. We used a meta-analysis to compare differences in the relationships between high job demands, low job resources, and job strain with QoC and counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs) across aged care and hospital settings. Data were extracted from 42 studies (n = 55 effects). QoC was negatively correlated with high job demands (⁠p= −0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.29, −0.15, k = 7), low job resources (⁠p= −0.40, 95% CI: −0.47, −0.32, k = 15), and job strain (⁠p= −0.32, 95% CI: −0.38, −0.25, k = 22), CWBs had a positive relationship with job demands (⁠p= 0.35, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.59, k = 3) and job strain (⁠p= 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.56, k = 6). The association between poor QoC and low job resources was stronger in aged care (r= −0.46, 95% CI: −0.55, −0.36, k = 8) than in hospital settings (r= −0.30, 95% CI: −0.41, −0.18, k = 7). Our findings suggest that relationships between low job resources and poor QoC are exacerbated in residential aged care contexts. To improve care outcomes, stakeholders should improve job resources such as skill discretion, supervisory supports, and increased training and staffing levels in residential aged care.","Does Context Count?

The purpose of this study was to develop and test the Abuser Risk Measure (ARM). The Rasch measurement model and traditional psychometrics were used on a sample of 425 elder abuse cases that completed an elder abuse investigation and had a substantiation decision (yes/no). All had usable ARM responses that were obtained primarily from the alleged victim. ARM construct/criterion validity was tested against four types of elder abuse using substantiation decision as the criterion. Item analyses guided the development of a full 21-item ARM measure and, subsequently, a short, 9-item screener. The 21-item ARM met the Rasch criteria. Although the screener was borderline on Rasch criteria, the combination of a good Cronbach’s alpha with strong criterion validation provided a rationale for endorsing its validity. Both versions of the ARM were significantly and most strongly predictive of physical and emotional abuse, and significant for financial exploitation. While not significantly predictive of neglect alone, they were strongly and significantly predictive of total types of abuse. This study was innovative in developing abuser risk items, analyzing client data, and generally supporting ARM validity for elder abuse. Theoretically, and now empirically, it is becoming clear that measures of abuser risk have an important role to play in both case assessment and in research.","Abuser Risk Measure: Reports by alleged victims to adult protective services Within the elder abuse field, research on the characteristics of the abusers is scant, and no validated measure of abuser risk exists.

"문영희, 강동욱",2018,social science,English,Legal-Policy Improvement-Measures for Prevention of Elder Abuse,"In Korea, the quality of life of elderly people has become a social task as it enters an aging society. As a result, elder abuse has been magnified as a social issue for not only the life guarantee of the elderly, furthermore to securing the human rights of the elderly. However, elder abuse is mostly occurring within the family, but when elder abuse becomes a problem, the abused elder often hide the abuse due to social criticism or punishment against their own children who did abuse to their. Therefore, the seriousness of elder abuse is not highlighted, and the actual situation is not well understood. Due to this reasons legal measures to prevent elder abuse are listed in several clauses in the ｢Welfare of Older Persons Act｣, so that it is not easy to intervene as national and social matters or deal with elder abuse. Also, the establishment and implementation of policies to prevent elder abuse is not effective. However, elder abuse is a representative example of human rights violations in the elderly. Therefore, without the prevention of elder abuse, the guarantee of the human rights of the elderly and the pursuit of the happiness of the elderly are nothing but empty echo that can not be realized. Therefore, from now on it is necessary to recognize the problem of elder abuse as a social problem beyond the problem of the family, to prepare comprehensive measures at the national level, and to improve the related legislation. In addition, it is necessary to establish and implement a system to prevent elder abuse in connection with the local community. And the policy on elder abuse needs to be transformed from the post consequence to the prevention center and from the report to the excavation center. In this paper, I propose measures to prevent elder abuse from the viewpoint of legal policy based on the examination on real cases of elder abuse. Specifically, 1. Establishment of social surveillance network to prevent elder abuse 2. Reinforcement of social responsibility for the elderly support 3. Expansion of the social welfare system for the elderly 4. Establishment of the abuse prevention measures according to the characteristics of the elderly 5. Expansion of services to prevent recurrence of abuse.","Legal-Policy Improvement-Measures for Prevention of Elder Abuse In Korea, the quality of life of elderly people has become a social task as it enters an aging society.

The analysis method were descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression. As a result, it was found that stress, teamwork, education and training are significantly related to maltreatment. Policy and practical implications are discussed as follows: first, it is necessary to discuss how to reduce the stress of the employees by sharing the coping strategy with the care workers who are burdened with the work performance and the situations that are likely to cause abuse. Second, the improvement of working conditions such as wage level and workload can not be considered as a decrease in maltreatment. Therefore, voluntary efforts of the facility(teamwork, education and training, etc) should be strengthened. Third, we should build a faithful environment for education and training, which had the greatest effect on maltreatment reduction. However, it is important to review the curriculum structure to ensure that education and training functions more effectively, rather than the monolithic idea of simply reducing maltreatment through education and training.","The Effects of Job Environment on Elderly Maltreatment of Care Worker in Long-term Care Insurance of Japan The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of job environments on the maltreatment of employees after controlling the personal characteristics of care workers. we conducted a questionnaire survey of 5,000 care workers who are working in nursing homes across Japan, and used data from 1,143 respondents for analysis.

For the research, six lower-court verdicts related to elderly abuse made between July 2008 when the Act on Long-Term Care Insurance for the Aged was enforced, and the end of April 2017 were analyzed. According to the result of this study, first, the types of elderly abuse that were litigated were: physical abuse, neglect, and multi-type maltreatment. Second, the verdicts of court against elderly abuser ranged from fine to imprisonment, prison servitude, and probation. Third, main issues related to verdicts on elderly abuse cases included: applicability of justifiable act as circumstances precluding wrongfulness when injury was inflicted during providence of care service; applicability of unintentional negligence (including injury and violence) as elderly abuse; and decision of sentence for the act of crime. Findings of this study suggest, in order to prevent elderly abuse in elderly care centers, first, a system for elderly abuse prevention and measures must be established based on education that can raise awareness of the gravity of elderly abuse and relevant punishment, and measures must be taken to protect elderly with dementia as they are the primary victims of elderly abuse.","Analysis of Precedents Related to Elderly Abuse in Elderly Care Facilities in South Korea : Focused on precedents after enforcement of the Act on Long-Term Care Insurance for the Aged This study analyzed precedents related to elderly abuse in elderly care facilities in South Korea by type of abuse and issue, and proposed the relevant implications, in order to help establish measures for prevention of elderly abuse in elderly care facilities.

임정미,2020,social science,English,Factors Affecting Perceptions of Maltreatment Among Care Workers: The Case of Japanese Long-Term Care Facilities,"This study explores the factors influencing the perception of maltreatment among care workers and examines the relationship between factors reported in the literature and this perception. A questionnaire survey conducted among 6,000 care workers in Japanese long-term care facilities yielded usable data from 1,473 respondents for the analysis. Based on literature reviews, independent variables were categorized into three types: individual, work, and institutional characteristics. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine possible relationships between these variables and perceptions of maltreatment. The results show that female staff who were qualified care workers were more likely to report a higher level of perceived maltreatment. Care workers reporting lower care stress were also more likely to perceive a higher level of maltreatment. The smaller the facility size, the more the facility operated as a social welfare corporation (i.e., as a non-profit business) and the more the facility built a culture that did not tolerate behavioral restrictions, the higher the worker's perception of maltreatment was expressed. Finally, the more the facility provided education related to care skills, the higher the worker's perception of maltreatment. In contrast, increases in workload, such as nursing care level and the number of night shifts, which were reported as risk factors in previous research, were not significant in this study. Based on the findings of our study, policy implications for the prevention of maltreatment among care workers are discussed.","Factors Affecting Perceptions of Maltreatment Among Care Workers: The Case of Japanese Long-Term Care Facilities This study explores the factors influencing the perception of maltreatment among care workers and examines the relationship between factors reported in the literature and this perception.

"권금주, 이서영",2014,social science,English,Study on Elder Mistreatment Behaviors,"The purpose of this study is to analyse the elder abuse behaviors of residential care facilities including homes for the aged, nursing homes, and group homes for aged in Korea. Using the qualitative analysis method, 298 elder abuse cases from 2011 to 2012 were analysed, and the data were classified into 132 behaviors, 43 behavior cluster, 20 sub-categories, and 7 categories of elder abuse occurring at residential care facilities. The seven categories were ‘physical abuse’, ‘emotional abuse’, ‘sexual abuse’, ‘financial exploitation’, ‘neglect’, ‘abandonment’ and ‘environmental neglect.’ Violence using by physical force and various instruments, sexual violence, financial abuse to infringe on lawful rights, and financial neglect to infringe on financial protection for the poor elders were not found at the residential care facilities compared with elder abuse assesment instrument and screening tool. Also, emotional abuse as infringing on autonomy and privacy, financial exploitation as making inappropriate charges of service, and neglect as not reporting elder abuse accidents by co-workers and other elders were found under institutional environments. Comparing with elder abuse assesment instrument and screening tool, ‘environmental neglect' was added to the elder abuse categories, due to considering the institutional environmental condition such as making a contract among the elder and the facility and providing the services to the vulnerable elders. This study would provide the information to develop elder abuse screening instruments of residental care facilities.

The seven categories were ‘physical abuse’, ‘emotional abuse’, ‘sexual abuse’, ‘financial exploitation’, ‘neglect’, ‘abandonment’ and ‘environmental neglect.’ Violence using by physical force and various instruments, sexual violence, financial abuse to infringe on lawful rights, and financial neglect to infringe on financial protection for the poor elders were not found at the residential care facilities compared with elder abuse assesment instrument and screening tool. Also, emotional abuse as infringing on autonomy and privacy, financial exploitation as making inappropriate charges of service, and neglect as not reporting elder abuse accidents by co-workers and other elders were found under institutional environments. Comparing with elder abuse assesment instrument and screening tool, ‘environmental neglect' was added to the elder abuse categories, due to considering the institutional environmental condition such as making a contract among the elder and the facility and providing the services to the vulnerable elders. This study would provide the information to develop elder abuse screening instruments of residental care facilities.

The data for this study was collected with 382  staffs in the Healthcare Facilities in Daegu. The major results are as follows. First, staffs characteristic has some statistical significance with elder abuse actions such as being single, working less than 3 years, or not participating any kinds of prevention education program about the elder abuse. Second, organizational environment variable has some statistical significance with elder abuse actions among the staffs when they have to  look after more patients, to take 3 shifts a day or to be employed by contracts. Third, among the residents dependency variables, performing daily activities, emotional dependency and recognizing dependency were associated with the elder abuse actions among the staffs. Fourth, the results showed that these factors affect elder abuse actions such as the workers have contract positions, they have 3 shifts a day, they have to look after more elders. With the result of this study, I’d like to suggest some plans for preventing from the Elder Abuse actions among the staffs in the healthcare facilities. The education programs about preventing elder abuse should be enforced for the experienced staffs. When there is an accidental abusing action, it should be reported immediately and should be recommended not to occur again. Moreover, the systematic environment for the staffs should be improved and their job should be changed to full-time job, and institutional support should be offered. Various programs for the elder should be provided and consistent education and training are necessary. In conclusion, the society needs to pay attention to the issues not to decrease the quality of life for the aged in the healthcare facilities. To prevent from elder abuse actions by the staffs, practical and realistic prevention programs should be offered  to the staffs of institutions.

"이미진, 김혜련",2016,social science,English,Comparing Elderly and Perpetrator Characteristics by Elder Abuse Type: Analysis of Elder Abuse Cases in Korean Elder Abuse Protective Service Agencies,"This study investigated whether elderly and perpetrator characteristics of elder abuse cases of Korean Elder Abuse Protective Service Agencies (KEAPSA) would vary by type of elder abuse. Four hundred and thirteen elder abuse cases abstracted by 80 case workers of 23 KEAPSA in 2013 for development of case closure index of elder abuse were utilized. Whether client and perpetrator characteristics would vary by physical, psychological abuse, financial exploitation, and neglect (excluding self-neglect) was compared. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that no difference of client characteristics existed between physical abuse and other types of abuse, but perpetrators who lived with the client, were not married, had mental disorders/symptoms, were (potential) alcohol or substance abusers, were more likely to conduct physical abuse compared to other types of abuse. As for psychological abuse, clients were more likely to have home ownership, no difficulties of performing activities of daily living (ADL), no mental disorders/symptoms, and no (potential) alcohol or substance abuser, and perpetrators tended to live with the client, to be married, to be (potential) alcohol or substance abusers and to be economically dependent on the client. The clients of financial exploitation were more likely to receive public assistance, to live with adult children, grandchildren, or others, and the perpetrators of financial exploitation were more likely to be female, older, not living with the perpetrator, healthy, (potential) alcohol or substance abusers, and economically dependent on the client. The victims of neglect had characteristics of exhibiting no home ownership, ADL dependence, mental disorders/symptoms, (potential) alcohol or substance abuse, and social isolation, and perpetrators of neglect were distinct in being not economically dependent on the client.

PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for studies published from Jan. 2000 to Sep. 2020. A total of 26 studies were reviewed. The definitions of RRA were inconsistent across the included studies. Types of RRA generally included physical, verbal, and sexual abuse. In terms of theoretical frameworks, one-third of the studies were conducted based on specific theories or models including standard paradigm, person-centered paradigm, need-driven dementia-compromised behavior model, socio-ecological model, and social learning theory. Also, to measure RRA, some studies used standardized measurement tools, but their validity and reliability were inadequate. The rate of observing RRA was higher than the prevalence rate. Factors that influence RRA were categorized into initiator, victim, facility, and situational characteristics. Results suggest the need for policy and intervention to prevent RRA as follows: conducting surveys of RRA, educating nursing home workers how to deal with RRA, applying related theories or models to interventions, making physical environmental changes in facilities, and establishing a protection and prevention system for high-risk groups.","Resident-to-resident abuse in nursing facilities: A literature review on studies in Western countries This study reviews studies on RRA in nursing facilities published in Western countries to provide knowledge base for RRA.
