In an era marked by rapid aging and digital transformation, precisely understanding the multifaceted and interactive factors that drive lifelong learning participation has become essential for building inclusive and effective educational policies. This study integrates machine learning and deep learning–based predictive modeling with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to predict adult learners’ participation in lifelong learning and to interpret its determinants. By quantifying these factors within both temporal and demographic contexts using national survey data from 2018 to 2022, the study identifies and validates the social dynamics that shape learning engagement. The results reveal that program accessibility, workplace size, informal physical activity, and life satisfaction significantly enhance participation likelihood, whereas socioeconomic vulnerability, outdated learning media, and certain broadcast- or media-based modes inhibit it. The influence of digital device–based learning has grown markedly since the pandemic, and learning motivations among older adults have shifted from economic gains toward health and cultural fulfillment. Furthermore, the study quantitatively explicates the interaction and directional contributions of structural, behavioral, social, and psychological factors, extending the boundaries of prior research. Policy implications include: (1) expanding structural support for vulnerable groups and workers in small and medium-sized enterprises, (2) enhancing digital competence and learner autonomy across generations, (3) developing community-based learning models that link civic participation with education, and (4) designing well-being-oriented programs that integrate learning with quality of life. Among the tested algorithms, the CatBoost model demonstrated the most stable and generalized performance (F1 = 0.7283, AUC = 0.8025), confirming the model’s effectiveness in predicting future participation based on key explanatory variables. These findings underscore that the credibility and usability of policy design are maximized when interpretation and prediction are coherently connected. Ultimately, this study provides a methodological framework for data-driven policy design toward an inclusive lifelong learning ecosystem in digital and aging societies—offering both empirical evidence for personalized program development and substantive contributions to academic innovation and policy practice.
